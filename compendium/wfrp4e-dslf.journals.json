          "text": "<p>Philanthropic Verenans and reformist Shallyans explain that criminal behaviour in the cities of the Old World is the natural reaction to the intolerable living conditions of the poor. They argue that its root cause is the vast disparity in wealth between landed aristocrats, successful merchants, and those who live a hand-to-mouth existence in the slums. Such enlightened views are entirely drowned out by pretty much every other voice of authority, unified in condemnation of illegal activity and calling for the harsh punishment of criminals. Especially the poor ones.</p><p>Common folk may turn out in their droves to watch a public execution, but they also have a fondness for the romantic rogue of folk legend. A minstrel who performs 'A Bandit Bold', recounting how one of the heroes who overthrew the Great Enchanter was a wanted outlaw, can expect an appreciative audience in tavern barrooms. Raconteurs find eager ears when explaining how the Empire might have fallen to the predations of the Vampire Counts of Sylvania were it not for the daring theft of the Carstein Ring by Felix Mann.</p><p>Similarly, people can have sympathy for the commoner who might break the law for a good reason. The poacher who only steals to feed his starving family, or the trickster who teaches an arrogant noble a lesson of humility. But these sentiments only go so far. These same people will keep a tight hold of their own purses for fear of pickpockets. Should they themselves become the victim of a robbery, they are usually satisfied to see the full force of the law be applied to the miscreant, in all its bloody extremes.</p><p>There are a couple of ways a career criminal can make life easier for themself. Those who join @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.journals.JournalEntry.iGJbarHnUGTU2SKc]{the Cult of Ranald} may find a network of support among those who share the Trickster God’s values and may learn the god’s miracles. However, Ranald eschews violence and despises those who prey upon the vulnerable, so @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.journals.JournalEntry.Gu0AnsYIpyHxK27i]{organised criminal gangs} exist for those rogues who do not wish to be limited by the Ranaldan code.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/images/market-pickpocket.webp\" /></div>"

          "text": "<p>Thieves sometimes start as Pickpockets, scraping a living by cutting purses. Other criminals may require their talents, with Forgers and Charlatans hiring them to help carry off scams. Despite this, they are looked down upon as petty criminals, unwilling to take risks for rewards greater than those found within unguarded purses.</p><p>Pickpockets move among their marks, living lives where the slightest mistake leaves them surrounded by enemies. They must learn to work the crowds, to read the flow of people as they move through the streets.</p><p>A skilled Pickpocket develops a keen understanding of people’s behaviours, and how best to exploit them. They become something part-way between a thief and a thespian. The street is their stage and all those who walk it follow their scripts. Learn those scripts, follow those patterns, cultivate a light touch, and soon the world opens to you, and every purse becomes yours for the taking.</p><h4>Spotting a Pickpocket at Work</h4><p>Usually, when a Character attempts to pick a pocket, they test against the Perception of the person they are trying to steal from. However, if anyone in the area is being vigilant of Pickpockets, an Opposed Sleight of Hand/Perception Test must be made against them as well as the victim. If a vigilant bystander spots a thief at work, it is up to them what they do with such information. Most folk do raise the alarm and seek the arrest of a thief.</p><h4>Pickpocket Career</h4><p>If a player generates a Thief as a starting Character, they may decide to focus on pickpocketing to the exclusion of other types of thievery. If so, they may make the following substitutions to the career.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Pickpocket Skills, Talents, and Trappings</em></h4><p><em>A Pickpocket Character uses the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.mBtIPoWNpXwAS5Yl]{Thief} Career with the following adjustments.</em></p><p><em><strong>At Level 1 (Prowler) they choose from the following Skills:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.sRuMlaPU5xdIrwhd]{Climb}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.1jCxbFAUuFuAPLJl]{Dodge}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.c6I7wHp56nulRLic]{Perform (Clowning)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.rvd0S8Z0v2m0MHmD]{Sleight of Hand}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.zkI6tIqbyAZvh0Th]{Stealth (Urban)}</em></p><p><em><strong>At Level 1 (Prowler) they make the following change to their available Talents:</strong> Swap @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.jt0DmVK9IiF6Sd2h]{Strike to Stun} with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.9sMAf0xmehjEmUao]{Fast Hands}.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>There are prepared Careers for Pickpocket as a separate Career Group: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.XfqWKmYwafPgef8x]{Prowler}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.d16atRZqVeFMh4ou]{Thief}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.Zvna0R6SZ8wjn4xs]{Master Thief} and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.ptnU0hIz4wo4Z2ja]{Cat Burglar}</p></blockquote><h4>Pilfering in the Game</h4><p>Almost every type of Thief, and some non-Rogues besides, find pickpocketing a useful skill. Even if the Characters don’t attempt it themselves, it is not unlikely that someone will try it on them.</p><p>In order to acquire an item from another person, a Character needs to pass an <strong>Opposed Sleight of Hand/Perception</strong> Test.

So, the purse of a Merchant (Silver 5) contains five silver shillings, and that of a Villager (Brass 3) contains three pennies. This is representative of the cash most characters take with them when walking the streets or spending time in a tavern bar.</p><p>As an option, the GM may roll on @Table[contents-of-purse]{The Contents of a Purse table} to determine some extra detail about the contents of a victim’s purse or other small items of value that may be on their person.</p><p>Unless they already know the person they are attempting to rob, the Pickpocket may suffer or benefit from a complication resulting from the individual character of their victim.

          "text": "<p>Burglars spend years developing their skills in stealth, slipping into homes, slinking through shadows, all while leaving no trace they were ever even there. Cat Burglars are the elite of the criminal underworld, figures whose exploits take on a life of their own, and whose skills are highly sought after. Some content themselves with window fishing, using telescopic poles to snatch valuables through windows — or a simple smash-and-grab. Whatever their approach, all Burglars live by a simple motto: get in, get stuff, get out, get gone.</p><p>Being a good Burglar takes time and patience. A thief may spend weeks casing a joint, finding the best moment to strike. Even then, getting inside is only the beginning. Guards, traps, dogs… the richer the target, the more security they can afford. Many thieves consider burgling the wealthy more trouble than it’s worth, preferring to break into smaller businesses and helping themselves to the money box. However, no one can deny the glory and profit to be won in escaping with the jewels of the nobility. These criminals become celebrities among those in the know, which isn’t always a good thing — when the wanted posters start appearing, new pastures beckon.</p><p>Burglars can come from any walk of life, whether starting out as low-level members of a criminal gang, or bored nobles seeking a thrill. Many maintain a legitimate trade or persona behind which they hide their activities. This protects them from the watch’s attention and provides a means to inspect their mark’s property. Often the first warning a victim gets is a helpful artisan turning up at their house, offering to fix the roof.</p><p>There are places in the Old World with particularly bad reputations for thieves: Bordeleaux, Miragliano, Marienburg, but Burglars work in every town and city.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Burglar Skills, Talents, and Trappings</em></h4><p><em>A Pickpocket Character uses the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.mBtIPoWNpXwAS5Yl]{Thief} Career with the following adjustments.</em></p><p><em><strong>At Level 1 (Prowler) they choose from the following Skills:</strong> @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.LGHozP5gmQ8cuDQV]{Athletics}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.sRuMlaPU5xdIrwhd]{Climb}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.1jCxbFAUuFuAPLJl]{Dodge}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.DRO5DLF6UcfkvNSh]{Lore (Local)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.jLyoyqwmBVPjRjhM]{Melee (Brawling)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.zkI6tIqbyAZvh0Th]{Stealth (Urban)}</em></p><p><em><strong>At Level 3 (Master Thief) they make the following change to their available Talents: </strong>Swap @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.a7v422EZcOUUC20X]{Trapper} for @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.PJ4oxDExnuFNr2Fi]{Secret Identity}.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>There are prepared Careers for Burglar as a separate Career Group: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.M6yH4rd27wkHIiM3]{Prowler}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.Dy610VDYOjqvncVU]{Thief}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.jHKSjOIYMw2fuK0j]{Master Thief} and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.items.Item.rbz9VWEvbgq8DWkZ]{Cat Burglar}</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/tricksy-halflings.webp\" /></div>"

In the case of watchmen, it may result in constant close surveillance and even harassment for a few weeks.

Some dogs find the scent stimulating and distracting, so burglars occasionally use it to distract guard dogs. If a Character is being tracked by dogs, they may leave a bag of tarrabeth seed in their path. Dogs who come within 5 yards of the bag should make an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test. Those who fail the Test spend [[/r 1d10]] rounds investigating the bag before taking up the trail again. If a dog scores an Astounding Failure (-6 SL or less), they are so distracted by the scent that they forget about the original trail they were following.</p><h4>Bag of Soot</h4><p>The finest soot is said to come from the cannon foundries of Nuln. A Character can use a bag of soot to stain their clothes, equipment, and exposed skin, making surfaces dark and dull. A Character who is covered in soot is harder to perceive in the dark. Any Creatures suffer -1 SL to sight-based <strong>Perception</strong> Tests made to spot the Character or discern anything about their appearance.</p><h4>Caltrops</h4><p>These many-sided spikes are sometimes scattered on battlefields to make areas unsafe for cavalry. A Character with caltrops may use an Action to scatter a dozen of them on the ground, creating a hazardous area 2 yards in diameter. Anyone entering the area must pass a <strong>Hard (-20) Athletics</strong> Test or be struck by the caltrops. If a Creature is aware of the caltrops and moves at walking speed, this Test becomes <strong>Average (+20)</strong>. Creatures who fail the Test take a Damage [[/r 1d10]] hit to a randomly determined leg and suffer a @Condition[Stunned] Condition.</p><h4>Crampons</h4><p>Crampons are wooden frames fitted to boots. Horseshoe nails are hammered through the frame to assist in scaling steep surfaces. Whilst wearing a pair of crampons, Tests made by a Character have the following modifiers:</p><ul><li><p>+2 SL to Climb Tests made to scale a rocky or wooden surface</p></li><li><p>+1 SL to Climb Tests made to scale a rope</p></li><li><p>-1 SL to Athletics Tests made outside the context of climbing</p></li><li><p>-2 SL to Stealth Tests made outside the context of climbing</p></li><li><p>-2 SL to any other Test involving movement made outside the context of climbing (it is best to remove crampons before attempting your dance steps)</p></li></ul><h4>Glass Cutter</h4><p>A short metal rod tipped with a hard shard of diamond or stonehorn. A Character equipped with a glass cutter can use it to bore a hole through a pane of glass or scratch out a panel that may then be knocked in with a mallet.

A simple periscope may be nothing more than a mirror lashed to the short rod, but purpose-built devices that house two angled mirrors within a sturdy frame are available. A Character with a periscope may use it to make sight-based Perception Tests while keeping their body hidden or within cover.</p><h4>Smoke Bomb</h4><p>A typical smoke bomb consists of a metal or ceramic vessel containing an alchemical cocktail, which is wadded in and lit by a fuse. A smoke bomb can be thrown exactly like an incendiary, though it does not burn at such a high temperature. Instead, it produces a thick cloud of smoke. The smoke is thick enough to fill a large room or an area 10 yards in diameter in the open air. The cloud persists for [[/r 2d10]] Rounds (double the number if the bomb is employed in an enclosed space).</p><p>Characters may not see through the smoke cloud and may only see 1 yard if within the smoke cloud. Furthermore, the smoke is not breathable, and any Character caught in the cloud must test to see if they suffer from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#drowning-and-suffocation]{Suffocation} as described in the <strong>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Core Rulebook</strong>. Smoke bombs are, therefore, effective ways to clear a room or cover an escape.</p><h4>Steel Mummit</h4><p>Named for one of the legendary companions of Ranald, this is a small thin steel tool that can be slipped between a door and the jamb in the hope of levering a bolt aside. Whilst a crowbar is used to lever a door open despite a lock, and a lockpick is used to spring a lock open, a steel Mummit acts on the bolt in the hope of jiggling it loose without the need to operate any mechanism. If a door is locked with a lock and key (not a padlock), or if it is bolted shut, a steel Mummit may be used to open it if a Character passes a <strong>Hard (-20) Sleight of Hand</strong> Test.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Steel Mummit Success Table</em></h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><tbody><tr><td><p><em><strong>SL</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Result</strong></em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>+1 or more</em></p></td><td><p><em>The Character springs the lock.

          "name": "Grave Robbers",
          "text": "<p>Stealing from the dead is a profession that attracts only the truly desperate. The undead are a popular subject of tavern tales, and these stories are enough to give even hardened thieves a healthy respect for Morr’s subjects. Also, the Gardens of Morr are rarely unprotected. They lie behind high stone walls, watched over by dour, black-armoured knights. More than one would-be Grave Robber has met their end upon a Black Guard’s sword, but if you are smart, stealthy, and careful, then the dead can be a source of wealth.</p><p>There are two kinds of Grave Robbers. First are those who plunder corpses of their valuables — they say you can’t take it with you, but this doesn’t stop people from trying. Even peasants can expect to greet eternity dressed in their best linen with a pair of pennies placed upon their eyes to pay Morr to allow them to enter his realm. Plundering in this manner requires planning and forethought. It’s a waste of effort to dig up a corpse only to find it carries no more than a bad stench. Grave Robbers, therefore, keep their ears to the ground, listening for when a wealthy burgher has popped their clogs.</p><p>Body snatchers, on the other hand, aren’t content with making away with a few belongings. Why bother when the corpse itself is valuable? There is always someone in need of a corpse. Experimental physicians desire corpses so that they can glean details about the function of the organs and the makeup of the circulatory system. Amethyst Wizards seek to understand how the dead attract the amethyst wind of Shyish. Gold Wizards may seek to use humours derived from dead bodies for their alchemical properties.</p><p>Whether stealing their valuables or the corpses themselves, Grave Robbers live a dangerous life. The Cult of Morr preaches intolerance of those who dare to desecrate graves, and even merely knowing someone who has been accused is grounds for suspicion. The horrors of necromancy are well known, and the slightest rumour can be enough to send whole communities spiralling into paranoia. Grave Robbers must, therefore, take great care. As in all theft, information is key — they must watch, wait, practise stealth and swiftness, and find a reliable way to rid themselves of their plunder without drawing suspicion. Only then can they rest easy, without fear of joining the ranks of the dead they plunder.</p><h3>Graverobbery in Operation</h3><p>Grave robbing is a risky practice. After identifying a site from which to steal a body, the Grave Robber must make their way past guards, find their target in the dead of night, then dig them up and slip away with their valuables (or earthly remains). A Grave Robber must succeed on an <strong>Extended Hard (-20) Combined Athletics and Stealth</strong> Test, requiring 5 SL to pass.</p><p>If this Test is not passed within 5 Rounds, the Grave Robber must contend with the guardians of the cemetery, either through stealth, violence, or trickery. Bribery is a possibility, though the Black Guards are sincere in their duty, and paying them to go away is not likely to succeed. The number of guards is up to the GM, but generally a city cemetery is patrolled by two guards, and a town cemetery by one. Smaller cemeteries are often unguarded, but Knights of Morr travel between them to provide protection, even if it is only briefly.</p><p>If the Grave Robber completes the Extended Test they access the resting place and find what they are looking for. If the GM wishes, there may be crypt complications relating to the manner of burial, corpse complicatiuons relating to the state of the body, or both.</p><p>The content of these tables is not intended to represent the sort of discoveries that happen every time a common grave is broken into. They tend towards rather dramatic consequences and ought to be used sparingly or to inspire a GM to come up with their own ideas. By default, the Pennies result applies to any common grave that is robbed in the hope of profit.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><p>@Embed[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.tables.RollTable.liL60o4HdmftKmHr]{You Unearth…}</p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><p>@Embed[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.tables.RollTable.DOLEoPudMLsOyxeU]{Result}</p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Father Maxwell of Talabheim</em></h4><p><em>In the year 2506 IC, Talabheim’s citizens were shocked by the double life of Father Maxwell, a much-loved priest of Morr.

These make tempting targets for those callous and disturbing rogues willing to ‘brave the grave’ during the hours of the owl. Even the poor fall prey to these villains, who sell their remains to Physik and Necromancer alike.</em></p><p><em>One grave robber of darksome fame was Meg Schwarz. Although as gaunt as a skeleton, her arms were strong, and it’s said she could excavate three deep-buried bodies a night by herself. A grimly silent creature, she preferred her own company, speaking little, glowering between the thick strands of her long, grimy black hair. Her clothes were those of her victims, sometimes decaying finery, sometimes pale grave cloth.</em></p><p><em>In her time, she is said to have fought with actual Ghouls in long-forgotten graveyards, taking a skull as proof. She outran one of the intimidating Knights of the Black Guard (though more salacious tales say she seduced him). Another story alleges a bounty was put on her by a famed Vampire after she staked one too many of his younger offspring.</em></p><p><em>Her untimely end came when she was finally cornered by a band of Black Guard (presumably faster and less easily charmed than the other fellow). Rather than be captured, she chose to climb the stones of the graveyard’s chapel to its roof from where she threw herself, shattering her bones on a monumental tomb below.</em></p><p><em>Meg’s story does not end here, however. She lives on in death, sometimes as an intangible spirit, sometimes as a tangible monster. In some tales, she is a protector of the newly buried, frightening off would-be despoilers of the grave. In others, she directs you to the grave you want. Her movement is slow, with sudden spasmodic jerks.

Once you reach a certain Status, you’re not robbing the dead, you’re preserving the past. However, some still operate on the other side of the law, delving into the grand tombs of a city’s elite.</p><p>For all their pleasant grand presence in Morr’s Gardens, these tombs are no less dangerous than other ancient barrows. The rich guard their belongings in death as they did in life, and traps, curses, and dedicated night watchmen are not uncommon. That’s not to mention the Ghouls, mutants, or other outcasts who make such places their lairs. Even if a Tomb Robber makes it out alive, they have to contend with living descendants.</p><h4>The Grey Mountain Cairns</h4><p>In 2497 IC the Lichemaster Heinrich Kemmler opened cairns in the Grey Mountains to raise a force of undead. Whilst he was thwarted in his ambitions by the Wood Elves of Athel Loren, he proved that the barrows on the mountainsides were more numerous than previously thought. Some are rumoured to hold great treasures, such as flying chariots and cauldrons that could be used to brew up storms. Whatever the truth of these tales, the Empire's tomb-robbing community talk about the fact they may have an archaeological treasure house, comparable to that of the pyramids of Khemri, on their own doorstep.</p><h4>The Border Princes</h4><p>The lands of the Border Princes offer rich pickings for Treasure Hunters. There are many ancient barrows within striking distance of the settlement of Akendorf, rumoured to contain fabulous wealth but also to be guarded by a skeletal horde. The tenuous, febrile nature of life in the Border Princes means a Treasure Hunter may be called upon to investigate recent ruins as well as ancient ones.</p><h4>Khemri</h4><p>Of course, the archetypal destination for Tomb Robbers are the crypt complexes and pyramids of ancient Khemri. The astonishing price that Khemrian artefacts fetch means that a constant trickle of hopeful hunters departs for that land. This is despite Khemri's notorious reputation as a place where the dead do not rest easily, where hideous bas reliefs and statues of stone and bone spring to life and slaughter intruders, and where deadly traps and crippling curses afflict those who manage to survive the horrors of the deserts of that antique land.</p>"

Their job involves putting people in contact with one another and giving reputable folk a taste of the Old World's seedier side.

Well, no sooner has she left when a new customer comes in and sees the instrument. “A genuine Ferring! Fit for Orfeo!” Apparently, this violin is made from the heartwood of a lornalim tree, and the fretboard is inlaid with fragments of bright stone, worth more than Stirland. “Do you own this?

Most begin small, such as clipping coins to mint their own. From there, they move to impersonating the handwriting of a Marienburg merchant, or the seal of an elector count. It’s dangerous work but accomplished Forgers walk a fine line to riches. With the right documents a skilled ‘artist’ can produce as many counterfeit paintings and knock-off sculptures as a rich fool will pay for.</p><p> Forgers rarely work alone, often teaming up with criminals to disseminate their products. While they do not like to reveal themselves, they quickly take to the adventuring life — especially if their work attracts attention.</p><h4>Fake It ‘Til You Make It</h4><p>Forgers often focus upon only one type of counterfeiting, be that dodgy currency or fake paintings. However, some Forgers become masters of multiple trades, using their wide-ranging skills to create all manner of mimicries.</p><p>A Forger may attempt the following either during an adventure or as part of their Income Endeavour.</p><h4>Counterfeit Coins</h4><p>False coins supplement many an artisan’s income. Clipping real coins gathers the required metal, which can then be mixed with a cheaper base, or made into coins that are slightly thinner or smaller than the genuine article.</p><p>A Forger needs suitable metal and a coin mould for the specific currency they are trying to fake. A new coin mould can be made if the Forger puts in a day’s work followed by a <strong>Hard (-20) Trade (Artist or Smith)</strong> Test. The Forger needs a quarter ounce of the base metal (gold/silver/brass) per coin made. They put in a day’s work followed by a <strong>Challenging (+0) Trade (Artist or Smith)</strong> Test. On a success, they can create up to 50 coins. On a failure, the coins are made, but they are visibly flawed. A batch of silver shillings forged in Nuln in 2510 IC are notorious for displaying Countess Emmanuelle's head on both sides. Such flawed fakes require an opposed <strong>Sleight of Hand/Perception</strong> Test when used to avoid being recognised as forgeries.</p><p>Merchants at markets refuse to take forged coins if they spot them, but they rarely raise a hue and cry about it. That bad money makes it into circulation is accepted as a reality of life. However, a repeat offender is soon reported.</p><h4>Bogus Documents and Seals</h4><p>Few places are barred to a person carrying the right piece of paper. Whether copying government seals or writing letters in someone else’s hand, Forgers skilled in such crafts are always in high demand from those who traffic in false identities or posing as an official. During recent turmoil in the Empire, thieves in Averland made off with a bronze statue of Marlene von Alptraum, claiming that Marius Leitdorf had commanded it to be seized for safekeeping. They were able to produce a writ as proof, apparently sealed by his own hand. The situation was not helped by the fact that the Count himself was unable to remember if he issued such orders or not.</p><p>To create a fake document or seal, a Forger must be familiar with the original. They may then attempt a <strong>Difficult (-10) Art (Calligraphy, Engraving, or Sculpting)</strong> Test, depending on what they are copying. The complexity of the job determines how long it takes, with a week’s work being the default. On a success, they create a counterfeit, which is noticed as a fake by anyone who passes a <strong>Very Hard (-30) Evaluate</strong> Test. On a failure, the copy is noticed as fake on a <strong>Challenging (+0) Evaluate</strong> Test.</p><h4>Forged Artwork</h4><p>Whether paintings or jewellery, Forgers have long found profit in counterfeiting fine art. Their creations are often valuable on their own merit, but that’s not where the big money lies. A Forger only needs to persuade one rich noble they are now the proud owner of an original sculpture by the renowned Grottio to be set for life.</p><p>To create a counterfeit artistic piece, a Forger needs to study an original to learn the artist’s style. This may take time, depending on the rarity of the piece and how willing its owner is to admit visitors. The Forger must carry out the Consult an Expert Endeavour to find a piece and request access to it. They need time to study the original, requiring the Forger to carry out an Extended Art Test with the SL and time required determined by the GM.</p><p>Once they have successfully studied the piece, they can attempt to recreate it with an <strong>Extended Hard (-20) Art</strong> Test, with the time and SL again determined by the GM. Both the Forger and the GM should keep track of any negative SL gained during this process. The more negative SL, the easier it is for a mark to tell the work is fraudulent. Should the Forger finish the piece, but decide it is not ready, they may begin again, and benefit from +1 SL thanks to the time they spent practising.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

          "text": "<h4>Fences</h4><p>Theft is one thing, but converting goods into money requires different skills. A @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.rGxspUwwXaJYCQKI]{Fence} knows how and where to sell stolen goods. They can find customers who will turn a blind eye to the dubious provenance of the items for sale.</p><p>The quality of a Fence depends on their network, and this can be a major influence on the prices they can secure for stolen goods. A Fence with contacts in the foppish nobility might purchase treasures such as a gold ring set with a stonehorn gem stolen from a countess’s wardrobe, or a necklace of glowing Brynduraz swiped from a Dwarf queen, but won’t be interested in a few sacks of undyed wool lifted from the deck of an unguarded barge. Conversely, someone who runs a shoddy antiques shop may buy common articles but won’t take a risk on a marble bust of Verena sculpted by Leonardo di Miragliano.</p><p>Good thieves get to know several Fences who specialise in flogging various types of loot. The closer the bond of trust between fence and thief, the higher the prices offered for goods. This trust is built on reliability, people without discretion don’t last long on either end of the deal.</p><p>Fences can act as patrons from time to time. They are the first people consulted when a client needs something specific, and readily pass that request on to a thief they believe they can trust.</p><h4>Forgers and Counterfeiters</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.ZSEymB08fs2aMhol]{Forgers} can provide smugglers with the permits that allow them to bring goods into the city, swindlers with certificates of authenticity for the art they sell (and often the forged art itself ), or any type of document imaginable, from bankers’ drafts to licenses to practice magic issued from the Celestial College in Altdorf.</p><p>Forgers are usually found in cities and larger towns, for that is where most of their clientele is, and because this is where they can get the materials and tools they need. In addition, the anonymity of a large city makes it easier for them to go about their work unnoticed.</p><p>The time a Forger needs to make a product depends both on their skill and how specific the needs of their client are. While a fake entrance permit to the city may be but a work of a few minutes for some, this expedience is bought by the Forger having the correct parchment, official seal, and the correct shade of ink. A thief who intends to steal the Staff of Volans from the Supreme Patriarch may desire a forgery to swap out for the genuine article. A Forger might takes weeks if not months to undertake this task, if they even have the skills to do so.</p><p>The quality of the forged piece, and the likelihood that it would be recognised as a fake, also influences how much time is needed to craft it. Objects that (hopefully) won’t face close scrutiny won’t need as much work as those that are going to be thoroughly inspected. Added to that, the more time needed to create the object, the more expensive or illegal the materials, and the more unusual the request, all can raise the price of a forgery.</p><h4>Information Brokers</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.CVWZWgt7yNyegQBk]{Bawd}</p><p>Information is power: knowing when a merchant’s coffers are full for payday, having a good bit of leverage for blackmail, or which of the watchmen take bribes to look the other way. This information is often the key to being a successful rogue. But information doesn’t come out of thin air. To get it, rogues rely on a network of informers. Servants at the local inns who know when wealthy travellers have checked in, chatty clerks at merchant houses who know about their master’s finances, and friendly contacts in the city watch — all people who can tell you the right thing for a few coins.</p><p>The other option is an Information Broker, someone who makes it their business to know things. Some hang out in gentlemen’s clubs, or visit social events of the upper classes, and build a network of contacts there. They do this so that they can stay on top of the latest gossip in those circles and identify marks that deserve to be swindled out of their money. Others frequent inns where travellers gather to mingle with the coachmen and sailors. These people make it their business to know about visitors to the city, why they are there, who they know, and whether they would make a good target.</p><p>The information these intermediaries gather is worth money to the right kind of people, and they know how they can profit from it. Some share what they know for a fixed fee, others for a share of the profit that an enterprising criminal stands to make, while others have a standing arrangement with local gangs to provide information for a fixed monthly sum.</p><h4>Muscle</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.KzLa2MSiSFpW2ubm]{Racketeer}</p><p>No matter how smart a charlatan is, or how fast a pickpocket can run, sometimes the person being swindled is smarter, faster, or simply stronger and meaner. At such moments, rogues might need Muscle to back up their schemes, or to dissuade a target from attempting to take back what they have stolen. In such situations, it is good to have contacts who can provide that service.</p><p>Most of the time, these assistants don’t actually have to fight, they just have to look the part. Often the goal is to intimidate, to make the other party back off, and to not actually use violence. This doesn’t always work, so you need muscle that can back up the threat of violence with the reality of violence. True professionals remain in control, only use the necessary amount of physical intervention, and minimise the mess.</p><p>Smart rogues know when to use the threat of violence, and when to deliver on it. They know that too much reliance on this instrument is likely to backfire, because there is always someone who is stronger and meaner.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/cat.webp\" height=\"200\" /></div><h4>Safe Houses</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.m0dpoUjUkzij6bbx]{Safe House Owner (Townsman)}</p><p>There are times when rogues need to disappear — when their victims or rivals are looking for them, or when the watch is eager to have a chat after that crown went missing. Or they might need a place to hide other things. Money, artifacts, people, weapons, livestock, whatever their scheme revolved around this time! Just until the heat dies down, of course.</p><p>There are people who can help: innkeepers who understand the need for extreme privacy for their special guests, priests of Shallya who help the poor against the oppression of the higher classes (when plied with a suitably tragic tale), or friends who can hide someone in their attic or an unused room.</p><p>Good safe houses have discreet ways to bring food and drink to the person hiding there, and the excellent ones include false walls and hidden doors. Hiding someone isn’t difficult, but keeping them alive without drawing attention to them is.</p><p>Sometimes just hiding is not enough, and a rogue or their loot (or both) needs to get out of town without being noticed. Safe house owners often know smugglers prepared to help move people and contraband in secret.</p><p>Safe houses are rarely found in the nicer parts of town. The watch may well think twice before entering Altdorf ’s Isle of Eels, the notorious Shantytown of Nuln, or Middenheim’s Ostwald district, but the threat from rival criminals in such areas can be just as dangerous as the attention of the authorities.</p><h4>Imposters</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.zMtkLS1AVXM7s6KA]{Charlatan}</p><p>To convincingly pretend to be someone else, a rogue needs the clothing and belongings that would satisfy the expectations of the people they are trying to fool. Practiced charlatans know how to provide all this, and the better ones also coach you on how to really pull it off.</p><p>Someone who pretends to be from Wurtbad should know about the Wurtbad Opera House, The Splintered Skull Inn, and the city’s hot springs. They would know people from that city, and have the names of business acquaintances, childhood friends, and drinking buddies. Often, documents detailing this background are provided, but they require careful study by the impersonator.</p><p>Accents can be learned, but must be practised. It takes time to learn the mannerisms of a new identity. Likewise, this new identity can be expected to have an extensive knowledge of certain subjects, based on his profession or interests, and the impersonator should know enough to be able to have a conversation about the subject. A wine merchant should be able to discern a Loningbruck Ruby from a Wurtbader Weißwein and be able to value them, to gossip about what business goes on in the auction houses in Wurtbad, and the grape harvest they’ve had.</p><p>Only a few customers have the time or money to follow this training well enough to be able to put on a satisfactory performance. However, those that do can often convince even the distrustful members of their audience that they are who they claim to be.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Characters may use this Endeavour to attempt to establish a Contact between adventures. This requires input from both the player and the GM.</p><h4>Define the Contact</h4><p>Tell your GM what you want the Contact to be able to do for your character. If you have an idea of what they might do, and what power or influence they wield, that can help too. Are they guards at the city gates, willing to turn a blind eye when you smuggle goods into town? A legal clerk with gambling debts and access to sensitive information? These suggestions help you to agree with the GM the status of the Contact you are trying to make.</p><p>Next, the Character must pass a <strong>Difficult (-10) Gossip Test</strong> and spend money equal to the Contact’s status. This represents the Character trying to identify a suitable Contact and build a relationship with them. If they succeed, they have made a connection and can complete the Endeavour. If they fail, they can try again with another Endeavour.</p><h4>Flesh out the Contact</h4><p>Now it’s over to the GM. If you have an NPC in your campaign who would serve as an appropriate Contact, great! So long as it doesn’t make any difficulties for the ongoing plots, a Contact already involved in the ongoing game adds to the feel of a deep and integrated world.</p><p>If you need to introduce a new NPC, make sure they add flavour to the game and build on the character’s skillset rather than solving all their problems for them. Contacts usually specialise in certain fields, though they might have a secondary use if it makes logical sense. For example, Fences cultivate a circle of clients and are only interested in items of interest to that group, but they might also pick up a range of useful information from their clients. If possible, link the Contact to groups and events from your game, to integrate them into the setting.</p><p>Once the Contact has been identified, flesh out the rest of their details. The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.YRON09FlUjVYGUci]{Character} chapter may help you pick a name, determine species, age, and the Contact’s starting Skills, Talents, and wealth.</p><p>You can decide how much detail to go into, but at a minimum you need a name, description, who of interest they know, and the values of their highest relevant skills (see @UUID[.yUR9H794drbiHFUa]{Contact Quality}). The more details you have, and the better you know the network of people the Contact works with, the more opportunities there will be to involve them meaningfully in your game.</p><h3>Example Contacts</h3><p><strong>Helmgard Trautmann, Innkeeper<br /></strong><em>So, you’re travelling to Altdorf on your own? How… errm… interesting.</em></p><p>Helmgard Trautmann is the owner of The Gloating Boar, a wayside inn in the Drakwald Forest — on the road from Altdorf to Middenheim, about two days from the latter city. The Gloating Boar is a favourite stop for travellers and coaches, and popular with road wardens, who can always count on getting free drinks with their meals.</p><p>What these people don’t realise is that Helmgard is a contact for the local gang of outlaws. She informs them of road warden patrols and wealthy travellers along the road. When road wardens are at the inn, Helmgard closes the shutters on the second-floor windows, to alert the outlaws that they can go about their banditry in peace.</p><p>Similarly, the storerooms in the cellars under the inn do not only house food and drink for the inn but also contain a number of false walls, behind which contraband can be stashed, or people can hide from the authorities. Quite often the road wardens at the Gloating Boar have organised posses to apprehend the outlaws, not realising that their quarry was hiding right under their feet.</p><p><strong>Udo Morgenscheid, Silversmith and Forger<br /></strong><em>How much do you think you could sell a necklace like this for? A crown? Seems about right, I’ll give you twenty for 8 crowns then, let’s say.</em></p><p>Udo is a talented silversmith, who supplements his income by making fashionable jewellery from cheap materials and passing them off as the real thing.</p><p>Not wanting to ruin his own good name, he has a number of intermediaries to sell these forgeries on for him. The money is good, and he would be excited to turn his skills to any items that promise a good return. He also picks up all sorts of interesting, and valuable, rumours from his legitimate business.</p><p><strong>Alrik Gottrisson and Fenna Gottrisdottir, Dwarf Thugs<br /></strong><em>Can we start crackin’ heads now? No? How about now?</em></p><p>After their mother died and their father descended into a life of drunken cruelty, Alrik and Fenna set out to survive on their own at a young age, in the scum-ridden lower quarters of Altdorf. Neither sibling is very bright, but what they lack in wits, they make up for in sheer aggression, enough to scrape a living as hired muscle.</p><p>Always working together, they are a vital asset to any thief who needs someone intimidated or knocked out cold — the only problem being that whatever you ask of them, you need to spell it out explicitly, or these two thugs are as liable to kill someone as give them the friendly warning that was instructed.</p><p><strong>Ulliafor Sunbright, Playwright and Charlatan<br /></strong><em>No, darling, stay in your role. If you really must curse, curse in Estalian!</em></p><p>Elves live long lives and their artists can thus spend many years perfecting their craft. Ulliafor Sunbright is no exception; she has been working on her play, an epic tale about Wavemaster Sullandiel Fartrader, for more than twenty years, and she is set to spend ten more fleshing out the details.</p><p>The playwright is certain that it will be a success — the tale of the Elves who took hold of Sith Rionnasc’namishathir, the ancient Elven fortress on which Marienburg was built, is a legendary one. In her script, Sullandiel, who facilitated the first trade agreements between Ulthuan and Marienburg, negotiates with the Human merchants in impeccable dactylic pentameter.</p><p>But even a genius must eat while perfecting their masterpiece, so Ulliafor has started a side business, coaching rogues how to impersonate respectable folk and helping wanted criminals adopt a secret identity. She knows enough of the theatre to change someone’s look with a new haircut, some makeup, and a change of clothes, but also creates a background for them, with the props to sell that story.</p><p>She’s finds that criminals struggle to get acquainted with their new roles. Few thugs are born actors, so she spends more time coaching them than she would like, but needs must if her masterpiece is to be completed.</p><blockquote class=\"parchment sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Ubran Myths<br />The Red-Scarfed Man</em></h4><p><em>During the Age of Three Emperors, countless refugees from across the Empire fled their homes in search of safety. Every step of the way they were beset by the threat of bandits and soldiers (often hard to distinguish), starvation, and disease. During this time, tales arose of starving families waking to find freshly killed rabbits lying close by, a warm blanket, or a bundle of sticks for a fire.</em></p><p><em>Others spoke of threatening brigands dropping like flies as arrows thudded into every one of them in a matter of seconds. In these stories, the benefactor was always a mysterious figure in hunter’s garb, whose face is half obscured by a red scarf.</em></p><p><em>The earliest formal references to the Red-Scarfed Man date from histories written following the end of the Age of Three Emperors. Folklorists claim some tales predate this time, though given their oral natures it is hard to prove. The Red-Scarfed Man remains popular with artists, including Detlef Sierck, who has promised to write a play about the Man if he can find an actor willing to cover his face for the whole play.</em></p><p><em>Wherever one goes in the Empire, sooner or later one hears a song or story about one of his exploits. While the oldest stories tell simply of gifts for the desperate or a well-placed arrow, later stories create more elaborate epics, populated with villainous barons, loyal allies, and a love interest, the only person ever to see beneath the scarf.</em></p><p><em>Being masked, the Red-Scarfed Man has become all things to all people: a revolutionary, an Elf, a mutant, a brave peasant, an honest noble, a Red-Scarfed Woman, even a Dwarf. People feel strongly enough about the Man’s identity to get into tavern brawls over it. The Man’s bow has become a magical item, its string only able to be drawn by true heroes. The red scarf, too, is sometimes portrayed as a magical garment, though it is often just a symbol, transforming one of good heart into a champion of the wilderness and those in peril.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p>"

When the Characters have to find out who poisoned a merchant’s son and the trail leads to an alchemist, they know that alchemist may admit that they sold the poison, but will not be willing to divulge to whom he did so.

A temple of Ulric is a ready purchaser of wolf pelts, too. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.actors.Actor.KtYgLHcSLpHmnGI2]{Bears} are hunted in the north and east of the Empire, and in Kislev. Their meat is not particularly pleasant, but their skins are valuable.</p><p>A hunter can sell or barter other items obtained from their quarry. The heads of great stags and bears adorn the walls of aspiring gentry who haven’t managed to kill one themselves. Unicorn heads make the ultimate trophy, but are so rare that they are often faked. Large animal teeth make fine jewellery and charms and there is a market for soft bird down and colourful feathers for hat decoration.</p>"

          "text": "<p>They say hunting is a noble pursuit. In Bretonnia they call it the sport of kings, and it is true that many nobles across the Empire indulge in the pastime. The more martially successful nobles, might cynically point out that there is plenty of sport to be had defending the Empire’s borders from her enemies, or even fighting in the incessant minor squabbles that break out between its multitude of baronies. But it is also fair to say that the sort of skills that hunters hone are the ones that often win battles.</p><p>It is a noble tradition that after a kill, the successful hunters drink the blood of their quarry. This is frowned upon as appearing a bit too close to the practices of proscribed gods, but nobles are a law unto themselves.</p><p>Nobles tend to hunt on horseback with large retinues. They also use teams of beaters or dogs to flush out their quarry, and then they dispatch it with sword, spear, bow, or even firearm, depending on the local fashion. This method is only possible because of the number of servants at their command, and their great wealth. Certainly, it is not done for food, as a good hunt costs more to host than the most lavish banquet.</p><p>Finding the hunting grounds on their estates hemmed in by agricultural land and lacking the great sport that their grandparents enjoyed, the nobility have begun to be more careful about their prey. No longer content to pick up the odd wandering deer, they have begun organising their hunting grounds, looking after the animals on their patch so they can be fit for the hunt, and being careful to leave enough breeding pairs so that their stocks increase.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-2DS4W1UqDR9TYg8U\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">A Reckless Rampage</h3><p>Nobles often vie with each other to stock their estates with the best hunting, the noblest beasts, or the most exotic creatures. When Graf von Holzkrug severs the wings from a captive Manticore and lets it loose on his estate in order to provide a intersting hunt tragedy results, the creature kills most of the hunting party and rampages across the neighbouring farmland. The Graf hires the Characters to track the beast down and capture it. Whilst the Graf wishes the Characters to disable the creature, he requires that they keep it alive so that he may have the privilege of taking the final, killing blow.</p></section><h4>Impressing One’s Peers</h4><p>Aspiring nobles like to show their wealth by organising events which are often more social gathering or political bun fight than actual hunt. These recreational hunts are so contrived that servants oten do all the actual hunting while their betters ride around aimlessly, swigging Bretonnian brandy, and taking credit for the kill.</p><p>It’s certainly a long way from the noble sport of a single hunter against a single animal in a battle of wills and wits. So annoyed by this sort of senseless killing, one Taalite priest has dedicated himself to interrupting these hunts, confusing the hounds, putting them off the scent, and covering the tracks of the quarry.</p><p>Some hunts are taken extremely seriously, and their hosts only invite like minded guests. For example, Baroness Leona von Kugelbach organises an annual hunt on her estate in the mountains of western Wissenland and only invites the keenest hunters, who still must practically beg for a place. The terrain of the Kugelbach estate is extremely treacherous and with the rivalry between many of these avid hunters, injuries are inevitable.</p><p>The estate of Graf Rudiger von Unheimlich was famous for being home to unicorns, which he hunted. Rumour has it that after catching a fellow noble with his mistress, Rudiger set them loose in his forest and hunted them to death. The graf later died in a hunting accident.</p><p>Demigryphs are prized by the nobility, and many prospective knights travel deep into the forest to track down these ferocious predators and capture one alive to be trained as a mount.</p><p>As keen as such knights are, they often need a hand to organise the expedition and help with logistics, navigation, and the capture. Some wealthy knights, on the other hand, outsource the entire endeavour.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-d4OPPhzumrkuXBOU\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Abominable Endeavours</h3><p>Baron Ludwig von Vasserheim is always looking to put himself above his rivals and has decided that his next hunt must have a Stirland Abomination. He has heard they can be found in the World’s Edge Mountains. Experienced hunters might accept a commission to travel there, or even beyond, and bring one all the way back to his estate. The less scrupulous, however, might just attempt to steal the one that lives in the Altdorf Zoo. Depending on their background and skillset the Characters may be hired to either help out in a glorious hunting trip, or take part in a shameful heist.</p></section><p>Griffons are highly prized mounts among the nobility of the Old World. If one can be found when young, it can be trained to serve its master loyally. The bravest knights might pride themselves on finding and taming their mount themselves, but many are not above buying an egg or a chick from a hunter. However, adult griffons are tenacious in protecting their young. They have incredible eyesight and may stalk their quarry for days on end.</p>"

This is especially true of nobles who live in one of the cities and whose estates lie within the more cultivated areas of the Empire. Hunting lodges are usually sited deep within the wilderness where more dangerous and exotic game can be found. These are often referred to euphemistically as the cottage, or the summer house, but typically, these lodges are fortresses in their own right. They are often in areas beset by Orcs, Goblins, or Beastmen, and they need to be defended whether the lord of the manor is at home or not. Smaller lodges can have a precarious existence; more than one noble has turned up at a lodge to find it occupied by the sort of quarry that is more than capable of fighting back.</p><p>When some nobles travel, they like to have their household and home comforts travel with them. They may feel like they are roughing it when wandering through the wilderness in pursuit of their quarry, but in reality it’s little more than a holiday.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar parchment\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>A Place of Privacy</em></h4><p><em>Hunting lodges are found far in the wilderness, and many nobles think of them fondly as places in which they can escape from the hurly burly of political life.</em></p><p><em>It is a popular topic of gossip in the Empire to share tales about profane rites, debauched parties, and criminal enterprises that take place in the hunting lodges of aristocrats. many of these tales are merely resentful slanders, but it is undeniable that hunting lodges are places from which the nobility can escape public scrutiny and accountability.</em></p></blockquote><p>Some nobles will escape to their hunting lodges as an opportunity to get away from politicking, and perhaps their entourages, taking just a few trusted companions and servants with them. Some nobles use their lodges to extend their politicking, inviting many influential people, and wining and dining them as best they can. They stake their reputation on the quality of the hunt, and on their skills as a hunter, just as some nobles might do the same by hosting a ball and showing their skill at dancing.</p><p>Some lodges are built to blend in with their surroundings and often look like a bigger version of the local houses. Some, in contrast, make great statements about the power of the noble and look as conspicuously like a fortress as they can. Most lodges are bedecked with hunting trophies, with the heads of great antlered stags poking from the walls and taxidermied bears guarding the hallways.</p><p>A few lodges keep a large staff all the year round, essentially a functioning manor house with all that that entails even if the owner only visits occasionally. Most hunting lodges though either close down completely while their owners are not present, or keep a small staff, perhaps only one family, to keep the place ticking over.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-y2C2T2UHlHmmDbL4\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Strange Times at the Lodge</h3><p>Baroness Ludwiga von Fluessburg’s hunting lodge in the foothills of the World’s Edge Mountains is in an area that was assailed by waves of rapacious Wyverns. Now, every summer, she invites the bravest nobles she knows to venture out and slay as many of the creatures as they can, and Wyvern attacks in the area have reduced significantly. The current bounty paid for Wyverns by the City Council of Bechafen is 60 GC, and reducing all the time. Characters looking to make a quick fortuen will have to be quick, able to blend in with the aristocratic hunters who visit the lodge, and able to bag a Wyvern and transport its head.</p><p>Baron Stephan von Schoen-Hochen recently began building his hunting lodge near the middle mountains in an area which suffered the depredations of elusive beastmen-like creatures. The construction has been beset by any number of problems from builders going missing, supplies disappearing, and ropes and pulleys being gnawed through. When the lodge is complete, he hopes to use it as a base to rid the area of the interlopers. Skaven from Middenheim are the culprits, and anyone investigating the disturbances risks being captured by them, and used as labourers in the darkness of Under-Middenheim.</p></section><h3>A Typical Hunting Lodge</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.scenes.Scene.RIGzBSYeyN8dVvK9]{Hunting Lodge}</p><p>This hunting lodge is typical of those found in the forests of the Empire. It is made mostly from local wood, while Mountain lodges might involve more stone in their construction. While the building appears grand compared to a cottage or farmstead, the wealthy nobles who built a place like this consider that they are roughing it, and so like to fill it with bucolic décor and rustic touches. To a hardened hunter or ranger, it feels inauthentic.</p><h4>Defences</h4><p>Some care has gone into the defence of the lodge, a wooden palisade around the courtyard and there is a fortified gatehouse. The main building boasts a stone tower that predates the lodge. The ground immediately surrounding the palisade has been cleared, but only for building supplies, and the undergrowth is fighting back.</p><p>There is a narrow track leading to the nearest road, which can just about accommodates a coach. The old tower is the reason the lodge was sited here, although its original purpose is unknown. When the lodge was built it was restored and given half-timber upper stories.</p><h4>Ground Floor</h4><p>The ground floor of the tower is used to store hunting equipment and outdoor clothing. It also features a reception area for relaxing and dining. As all serious-minded nobles must have a study, a dedicated room contains a desk, and a few books on hunting, bird spotting, tips on fly fishing, and fiction about the daring exploits of young noblemen.</p><h4>First Floor</h4><p>The first floor features four large and lavishly decorated bedrooms reserved for the visiting noble and his most honoured guests.</p><h4>Second Floor</h4><p>Smaller rooms for servants, guards, and storage are found on this floor, as well as a small shrine to Taal bedecked with trophies such as tusks, antlers, and skulls.</p><h4>Third Floor</h4><p>The top floor can only be accessed by climbing up the tower.

As well as managing the land to make it attractive for potential quarry, they must also guard that land from poachers. Though Gamekeepers are likely to be from the same community as poachers, and perhaps sympathetic to their needs, woe betide if their master has a poor hunt. It is vital that they keep their master’s stocks safe, even as their neighbours go hungry.</p><p>While some gamekeepers show their love of the outdoors and their respect for wildlife, some are just bullies who love their authority and the chance to lord it over fellow common folk. They meet any incursion upon the estates they view as their own, with brutal violence.</p><p>As the aristocracy increasingly turns towards having managed hunting grounds on their expansive estates, there is an increasing need for people to do the managing. Gamekeepers are responsible for this and spend more of their time out in the fields and woodland making sure it can attract and support as many animals as possible, and making sure none of these stocks are stolen by poachers.</p><h4>The Duties of a Gamekeeper</h4><p>One of the roles of the gamekeeper is to protect the game from competition and predation. Therefore, they must hunt and trap vermin, and kill or scare off dangerous predators. Gamekeepers are often the first to know if there are threats like Forest Goblins, packs of Ghouls, or Beastmen warherds encroaching on a noble estate. If this threat is limited to a few scouts the Gamekeeper may deal with it themselves. If it is a larger force, they try to escape and warn others.</p><p>One job of the gamekeeper is to make the estate attractive to game. Experienced gamekeepers know when and where to grow the right combination of plants to entice animals onto the estate and keep them there. They build cunning enclosures that trap the game without them realising it, taking advantage of natural features like gullies and ravines to hem them in, and then construct unobtrusive ha-has and fences to prevent them escaping.</p><p>During the hunt a gamekeeper guides prey into the path of noble hunters, makes sure the hunters are safe, and that the hunt goes as successfully as possible. It is an art to track and kill a giant wolf while convincing a drunk, incompetent noble that they did it themselves.</p><h4>A Figure of Authority</h4><p>One thing a gamekeeper might need to deal with, especially living in an isolated village, is that they are doing the bidding of the lords of the manor and stopping the villagers from getting the food that many consider to be theirs by right. Some nobles are considerate of the local populace, and generous with their resources, but many rule more harshly, keeping them down as much as they can for fear that if they give them an inch, they will rise up and demand more.</p><p>Landowners employ gamekeepers to look after their game and the terrain that supports them. However, ‘looking after’ often means protecting the animals from poachers. So, in many places gamekeepers are little more than officers of the law, a bit like a privatised army of roadwardens, knowing little about hunting wildlife but much about hunting criminals.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/trap.webp\" width=\"250\" /></div><h4>Poachers and Gamekeepers</h4><p>The war between gamekeeper and poacher can often be a sedate one, with give and take on both sides and an uneasy or sometimes even friendly, peace, if the poacher is not too greedy. On other estates it can be much more ruthless, with gamekeepers shooting to kill, laying dangerous traps to catch unwary poachers, and even resorting to murdering persistent offenders.</p><h4>Looking for Adventure</h4><p>Though many gamekeepers spend their working life on the estate of their employer, their expertise might come in useful elsewhere. A good knowledge of the terrain and how to live off the land comes in handy on any expedition.</p><p>Many young gamekeepers leave their estates behind, looking for adventure in the wider world and their siding with law and order immediately makes a good impression with many institutions who will be prepared to employ them in the pursuit of justice. An experienced gamekeeper, perhaps with a decent reference from their erstwhile lord, will not find it hard to pick up casual work on estates across the Old World, especially during hunting season. An adventuring party might well benefit from their skills, particularly when it comes to tracking and bringing down a rampaging Razorgor or band of Forest Goblin scouts.</p><div class=\"journal-image

There aren’t so many rabbits here in Altdorf, but at least I have all my fingers.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Solvej Vestergaard, ex-poacher</em></p><p>‘Mind you, in those days just about every man in our village was out in the woods at night poaching pheasants. They did it not only because they loved the sport but because they needed food for their families.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Daniel Schmidt, Champion Poacher</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You hunt and trap for food in a battle of wits against your quarry and the powers that be.</em></p><p>Many common folk in the Old World believe that beasts and birds are sent by Taal to feed any with the wherewithal to catch them. In the Empire however, whoever owns the land claims to own the animals that walk upon it, and even the birds that fly above it. From a poacher’s point of view this is not how things should be and it is certainly not what the gods intended.</p><p>Poachers can be driven to their career through poverty and desperation, risking punishment to feed their family. Or they could see it as a test of their skill, the battle of wits between poacher and gamekeeper, just like the battle of wits with their quarry. This is not a decision taken lightly, every citizen of the Empire is warned to keep away from the wilds at night for fear of Ungor raiders, Giant Spiders, roving Razorgor and other threats.</p><p>Poachers make a living by catching food from the estates of their betters. Small scale poaching is a common enough activity across the Empire, as it is not usually seen as proper theft among the peasantry. This does not mean that the consequences are not serious and landowners who wish to can bring terrible punishments upon poachers who are caught but it is hardly the sort of criminality that sees the miscreants condemned by their neighbours though.</p><h4>Friends Among the Locals</h4><p>Often the locals are complicit in the act, providing cover for poachers and benefiting from their catch. It is seen as a pastime that improves the lives of all in the community, and one that the wronged landowner will barely notice.</p><p>Small-scale poaching is the occasional pursuit of many common folk in rural areas, especially those with a well-stocked hunting ground nearby. Some poachers find they have an aptitude and a passion for the game and take things further. Instead of the occasional foray into private land when they are in need, they turn this into a full-time profession and are out most nights after illegal quarry.</p><p>The most successful poachers manage to catch enough that they can sell or barter their goods and make a tidy living. Those who manage this find they need to keep in with their neighbours as much as they can and so are inclined to spread the profit around. For example, it is a common scene in many areas for the local road warden to tuck into a game pie.</p><h4>Poacher Gangs</h4><p>After a period of risk and getting their hands dirty, some ambitious poachers step back from the nitty gritty and organise gangs to work on their behalf, living off the work of others. They might arrange a network of poachers and other petty criminals ranging across a number of villages, coordinating their activities, to accrue and dispose of as much ill-gotten game as possible. If they are able to keep their gang safe from the authorities, they will have gained a certain notoriety and respectability in their field.</p><p>Some nobles are surprised at the extent of such networks and how their employees and other locals benefit illicitly from their estates. The locals are apt to stick together and even some of the roadwardens and other officials will turn a blind eye for a brace of pheasant or a cut of venison.</p><h4>Looking for Adventure</h4><p>Poachers should not find adventure hard to come by outside of their patch. Perhaps they have been driven off by enthusiastic gamekeepers. Perhaps they have been caught, and next time it’s their finger — they may have even lost a finger, and decided the game is up. A poacher can use their knowledge to help any group of adventurers, especially outdoors. Their foraging could feed a party single-handedly, and their stealth in the wild is invaluable.</p><p>They are familiar with evading a multitude of threats that can make life hard for an adventuring party, such as spotting the telltale webs of Giant Spiders, the spoor of a passing herd of Beastmen, or the spine-tingling bellow of a Great Stag marking out its territory.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/brace.webp\" width=\"250\" /></div><h4>Punishment</h4><p>Throughout the Old World the typical punishment for poaching is for the miscreant to lose a finger. More lenient lords may force a poacher to serve the cults of Taal or Rhya for a period of time. Crueller lords may set a poacher loose on their estate before turning the hounds on them. In estates by the Reikwald it is seen as sporting to turn a poacher loose at night without weapons, if they can make it back to civilisation without being caught by Forest Goblins or Beastmen they are considered to have earned their reprieve.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/actors/poacher.webp\" /></div><p><strong>Species: </strong>Dwarf, Halfling,

Even in the most civilised settlements, there are areas where the Watch are reluctant to tread, such as the anarchic Isle of Eels in Altdorf or the impoverished Ostwald district of Middenheim. In some regions of the Empire, such as the benighted land of Sylvania, the authorities are broadly neglectful of the safety and security of their subjects.</p><p><strong>Who Commits the Crime?</strong> Even in its civilised quarters the Empire does more to protect the elite than it does the poor and desperate. Many authorities summarily punish miscreants from the Brass Tier to show that they are not shy of enforcing the law, whilst those from the Silver Tier may be treated with more lenience. Those in the Gold Tier, especially the nobility, are not technically above the law but treated with such dignity and deference that their trespasses go unpunished unless they are public and gratuitous enough to embarrass their peers.</p><p><strong>Who is the Victim?</strong> Conversely, those whose crimes target their social superiors are regarded as not only offending against their victim but against the social order. Should an aristocrat strike a commoner in rage, the courts will likely decide that the impertinent churl deserved it.

Others are more authoritarian.</p><p><strong>The Prime Estates —</strong> The Prime Estates are a body of nobles and their delegates that meets in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.JournalEntry.rSRadYoaNXkEq8gs]{Altdorf} to scrutinise new legislation and dissuade the Emperor from imposing unwelcome edicts.</p><p><strong>The Nobility —</strong> Nobles with secure tenure of their estates may be as resistant to the imposition of edicts as the Elector Counts, meaning that regions within a province may follow different laws. While most barons adopt the laws of their own liege, some are petty tyrants.</p><p><strong>The Cults of Sigmar, Ulric, and Verena —</strong> The Grand Theogonist of Sigmar sits on the Council of State, and the cult tends to support the Emperor in the name of Imperial unity. The Cult of Ulric tends to be sceptical of legal changes and averse to appearing to be cowed by Sigmarite influence. The Cult of Verena strives to record the laws of the Old World, debate their efficacy, and suggest improvements. The Verenan Lector Agatha von Böhrn sits on the Council of State, though she has grown increasingly reluctant to advise reforms.</p><p><strong>Religious Courts —</strong> Each religious cult maintains a body of law governing what it considers the proper behaviour of its monks, nuns, and priests. Crimes of blasphemy and heresy are tried in such courts and vary from cult to cult.</p><p><strong>Military Tribunals —</strong> The Empire’s armies also tend to follow a set of laws distinct from regional laws governing the punishment of deserters and insubordinate troops.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar parchment\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Unpopular Edicts</em></h4><p><em>Despite the fact that the Emperor is advised to exercise caution when it comes to issuing edicts, there have been a number of times in the Empire’s history when unpopular laws have been pushed through without due consideration. The Halfling Licensing Proclamation was issued in 2373 IC by Emperor Leopold. This legislation was designed to provide funds for the imperial treasury by obliging anyone who employed a Halfling cook to purchase a license. Following protests by the nobility (amongst whom it was fashionable to employ a Halfling cook) and the grandees of the Moot, the edict was rescinded. In the early years of her troubled reign, Empress Magritta convinced the Prime Estates to back her anchor tax, but they stopped enforcing the legislation when ship’s captains began throwing their anchors overboard and ports became dangerous places due to all the drifting vessels.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Litigants —</strong> There is a body of written legislation and an understanding of precedence that justifies a professional legal class trusted to interpret the law. Their influence usually ends at the walls of the larger cities, and they must be aware that the laws they learn about may vary from those of neighbouring regions.</p><p><strong>Guilds —</strong> Motivated by the need to protect their interests and reputation. The seriousness with which a guild takes the task of enforcing standards and those conditions it recommends for its members vary from place to place, though within the Empire, there is a fairly consistent approach to such matters.</p><p><strong>Kommissions —</strong> Set up to gather public opinion and present it in a digestible form to legislators. In places such as Middenheim, they are considered an integral part of the process of developing laws. More cynical regimes may use them to reassure the populace that they are being listened to, or do away with them altogether.</p><p><strong>Town Councils —</strong> May govern on behalf of a local noble or in their own right in the case of towns that have been chartered, such as Kemperbad. The growing influence of such councils is a concern to the nobility, who see them as undermining their traditional authority.</p><p><strong>Village Elders —</strong> Generally, villages and farmsteads look to the nearest town for protection. If they apprehend a suspect, villagers send word or wait for a travelling magistrate to visit the village. Isolated communities may impose their own justice rather than wait.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar parchment\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Talabheim, the City of Laws</em></h4><p><em>Any town with a storied history is likely to have a corpus of laws appended to charters or derived from a patchwork constitution — part precedent, part written documentation, and part received wisdom. The city of Talabheim sits at a geographical and historical crossroads. Sited at the centre of the Empire, it was pivotal during the events that led to the Age of Wars. Perhaps this is why it has ended up with such a bewildering legal system, influenced over years by an Ulrican north, a Sigmarite west, and Taalite traditions. Whilst it was at the centre of political instability, Talabheim has endured, and its records date back to the time of Sigmar and beyond. Members of Talabheim’s Litigants’ Guild are constantly busy collecting and compiling these laws and producing books aimed at interpreting the law for various special interest groups, such as nobles or merchants.</em></p><p><em>Talabheim’s student lawyers do not learn every law, but they are expected to know how to find them. The need to master the vast library of information can lead to competition between students. In Talabheim it is not unknown for those unfamiliar with the city to be preyed upon by a young litigant, enquiring after such information as the status of their cat license.</em></p><p><em>Here are some of the laws that Characters may encounter during their time in Talabheim.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>“In times of civil strife, citizens may carry weapons no larger than their forearm.” The Zweig Act was drafted after thugs took advantage of a siege and carried swords and polearms to prey upon other citizens.</em></p></li><li><p><em>“Dwarfs are to be granted free and unimpeded entry through the Wizard’s Way on the 5th day of every month.” Passed in 2115 IC after successful lobbying by the Dwarf Iron Guild of Karaz-a-Karak.</em></p></li><li><p><em>“Fish caught in the Talabec are considered property of the Office of the Purse. Fish over three pounds must have one-quarter of its flesh allotted to the Minister for assessment.” Issued in 2240 IC by then High Counsellor Johansberg, former Minister of Taxation. These days this law is only enforced in the case of nuisance angling.</em></p></li><li><p><em>“Consumption of alcohol within the Field of Absolution is limited to one tankard of ale or its equivalent per person, with an additional Witness Tax of 1 shilling per drink.” Part of the Hard Spirits Bill of 2105. Used as a measure to reduce potential rioting during executions.</em></p></li></ul></blockquote>"

          "text": "<p>In the towns and cities of the Empire the most obvious form of law enforcement comes the watch. These are people employed to act as garrison and peacekeepers. Apprehending wrongdoers is a routine task for members of the watch, and for most criminal Characters avoiding, bribing, fooling, or otherwise dealing with the watch is a professional hazard.</p><p>The makeup of the watch varies from place to place. Most cities and larger towns employ a full-time contingent of watchmen who regularly patrol the streets both night and day. Smaller towns and villages may not be able to fund watch stations and patrols, but still employ guards to keep an eye on the gates and the walls. In rural areas local families are used to forming mobs to capture criminals.</p><h3>Determining Watch Presence</h3><p>Asuming the Characters are operating in a city or town, then there is a chance that a watch patrol may pass by as they are in the process of committing a crime, or be close enough to respond quickly if a hue and cry is raised by victims or bystanders.</p><p>To determine the presence of a Watch patrol roll on the @Table[watch-presence]{Watch Presence Table} with the the following modifiers:</p><ul><li><p>+1 If the setting is a city.</p></li><li><p>+1 if the neighbourhood is a wealthy district or busy market area.</p></li><li><p>+1 if there is a Watch post or station visible from the scene of the crime.</p></li><li><p>+1 if the Crime Crackdown or Riots Event occured during the last period of downtime.</p></li><li><p>-1 if the setting is a small town.</p></li><li><p>-1 if the neighbourhood is a poor area.</p></li><li><p>-1 if the crime takes place between 11 pm and 5 am. </p></li><li><p>-3 if the neighbourhood is a notorious rookery, or no-go area as far as the Watch are concerned. </p></li></ul><p>Of course, any criminal with their wits about them knows to keep an eye out for the watch, and refrain from criminal activity whilst they are in the vicinity. The easiest way to deal with a watch patrol is simply to wait for it to be on its way. However, in busy markets and thoroughfares, another patrol may be along in short order.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.tables.RollTable.DyreWwpt6MkN8y79 noCenter=true]{Result}</p><h4>Crimes and the Watch</h4><p>It ought to be noted that whilst @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.ykONebW4w2Rd47NX]{Watchmen} are employed to enforce the law, few of them are experts at it. They act to arrest those in the process of obvious crimes but may not even recognise other acts as criminal. A Watchmen may well apprehend those who shout seditious slogans in public, steal from market stalls, or start a tavern brawl but are unlikely to worry about a case of fraud or extortion unless a complaint is made to them specifically.</p><p>This means the GM should be judicial about what a Watchman would notice if they did perceive a crime in progress. If it is an assault or pickpocketing, then the miscreant’s arrest will likely be swift. If it involves passing off forged coinage or persuading someone to take part in a scam, the watch likely will not take notice unless an argument develops.</p><p>In cases where it is not clear if the behaviour ought to be regarded as criminal or not make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Law)</strong> Test on behalf of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.LPapTyGTMzSnd297]{Watch Sergeant}. If this is passed, they make an appropriate call.</p><h4>Watch Patrols</h4><p>In cities and large towns, a watch patrol typically consists of two to five @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.ykONebW4w2Rd47NX]{Watchmen} led by a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.LPapTyGTMzSnd297]{Sergeant}. In times of widespread disorder, patrols may be expanded to six to ten Watchmen. </p><p>In times of public unrest watch patrols are assisted by bands of part-time volunteers. The most famous of these is Altdorf ’s Citizens Vigilance Committee. Ostensively a group of patriotic vigilantes, this group is effectively a front for the dockside gang known as the Hooks.

          "name": "Caught by the Watch",
          "text": "<p>If a Character is caught in the act by the watch, several things may happen. Whilst the watch are employed to enforce the law, they are not there to judge whether a suspect is innocent or not. In the case of petty crimes committed by poor suspects, the watch are used to taking matters into their own hands rather than going to the trouble of putting criminals through the judicial system.</p><p><strong>Punitive Beatings —</strong> In the case of minor crimes such as public disorder, affray, nuisance behaviour, or petty theft, the Watch is often satisfied to administer a street sentence. This typically involves attacking a Character until they suffer a critical injury, at which point the watch moves on, satisfied the criminal has been taught a lesson.</p><p><strong>Spot Fines —</strong> An alternative, or addition to, the street sentence is the spot fine. This involves seizing all money and valuables from a criminal. If the criminal doesn’t carry much, they may get off lightly, but if they happen to possess expensive valuables these are confiscated as so-called evidence, and likely never seen again.</p><p><strong>Arrested —</strong> In the case of serious or repeat offending, the Watch will transport the miscreant to the nearest watch post and throw them in a cell. From here, they are taken to the nearest gaol to await trial at a local court.</p><h4>Liberating a Prisoner</h4><p>If Characters are looking to free a friend from custody the best time to do it would be before the case reaches court. Watch posts tend to be small, sturdy buildings staffed by a couple of Watchmen and with enough cells to house up to six prisoners at a time.</p><p>Springing a confederate from a watch post cell may be difficult, but it is far easier than getting someone from a gaol before or after a trial.</p><p>If someone is liberated in this manner, it is wise for all those involved to find a new place to call home as quickly as they can. Fugitives from the law are treated harshly if they are recognised by those they absconded from. If their identity is known to the watch, they will likely be declared an outlaw, who will, therefore, not be able to expect any protection from the authorities and will be sought by bounty hunters.</p><p>For more on gaol breaking see @UUID[.6hPtUwOOYBHMsTHK#new-endeavour:-gaol-break]{New Endeavour: Gaol Break}.</p><h4>Noble Prisoners</h4><p>The fact that nobles are usually spared the rough end of the law does lead certain young baronets to regard it as a form of sport to make a nuisance of themselves at the expense of the common folk. Most aristocratic houses indulge their wayward scions and excuse their misbehaviour as youthful exuberance. However, they do know the pranking and obnoxiousness of young noblemen is ready fodder for the pamphlets and street preaching of agitators. Most noble families see to it that the errant behaviour of their peers is kept in check, even whilst they do all they can to ensure that legislators do not eat away at their ancient privileges.</p><p>Any Character who possesses the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.1IVGksL10N7GVrw3]{Noble Blood} Talent is likely to be treated with far more consideration than their fellows if they are caught committing an offence or suspected of criminal activity.</p><p>If a criminal is recognised as an aristocrat, they are most likely to be spared immediate consequences such as punitive beatings, fines, or arrests. The watch typically do all they can to look the other way. If the noble’s crimes are so public that it would embarrass the watch to leave them be they may well detain them, but only for so long as it takes to contact a higher authority who knows about the proper way to deal with an errant noble.</p><p>The treatment of the noble prisoner depends on the relationship the rulers of the town have with the noble family in question. If they are friendly, then punishment may be limited to a stern warning and promises of calling in favours in time to come. If they are enemies, then the noble may be held as a hostage until an exorbitant ransom is paid. Imprisonment may result, but the prison itself is likely to be lavish compared to the cells of the local prison. Even nobles who hate one another are usually careful about how they treat aristocratic prisoners, the boot may be on the other foot someday.</p><p>Few Watchmen are experts in heraldry or genealogy, so a noble who faces arrest without making it clear they belong to an aristocratic line is treated no better than anyone else. This isn’t hard — merely the sound of an upper-class accent is enough to give a Watchman pause for thought. There are members of the watch who resent the presumption that a noble be spared the consequences of their misbehaviour and do all they can to make the process as difficult as they possibly can without endangering their own livelihoods.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Despite the efforts of many luminaries of the cult of Verena, who preach that justice ought to be served through a consistent implementation, there is a vast disparity in the experience of those brought before magistrates in the Old World. The degree to which a plaintiff is heard and the consequences for those found guilty differ according to local legal traditions, the social class of the accused and those they offended, and the temperament of presiding magistrates.</p><p>Even within the Empire the experience of the accused can vary wildly. In the backwaters of Sylvania, justice is rough and arbitrary. A lord may simply appoint a favoured crony as magistrate, who is ordered to do little more than keep the peace and protect the interests of the nobility. In such places, heinous crimes may be overlooked if they only affect the poor, whilst a trivial trespass against a friend of the powerful might be punished by terrible torture, mutilation, and execution, often in sequence.</p><p>Even in more civilized places, trials are often more about keeping the appearance of justice being done rather than allowing the accused a genuine chance to argue their innocence. Typically those determining whether the accused ought to face punishment have made up their minds before the trial begins, and any court proceedings that take place are limited to making a record of the account of those who made the arrest and allowing the accused to prove that they possess the integrity to face their fate with grim stoicism. </p><p>Yet there are circumstances where a case may be taken more seriously. Nobles and Characters who demonstrate the ability to read and write who are accused of a crime are often allowed to plead their case and may even hire litigants to help them present a legal argument. This is a luxury afforded to the lucky few, and only if the local authorities allow it.</p><p>Shallyan and Verenan reformers argue that even common folk ought to be afforded the chance to plead their case and that cruel and unusual punishments for minor crimes should not be arbitrarily levied. In cities such as @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.JournalEntry.rSRadYoaNXkEq8gs]{Altdorf} and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.JournalEntry.PuIrlGBOjxuWpK3P]{Middenheim} they occasionally find sympathetic ears, though their critics are quick to jump on any subsequent unrest as proof that being soft on criminals results in disorder, and a return to traditional harsh measures is usually quick to follow.</p><h3>The Basic Trial Process</h3><p>The GM ought to decide, depending on the circumstances, what sort of justice an accused Character faces. The more civilised the area, and the higher the social class of the accused, the more likely they are to receive a fair trial.</p><h4>Rough Justice</h4><p>In places where the local authorities care little for legal process, the presiding magistrate will do little more than review the apparent facts and pass a sentence. The accused has only a scant chance of influencing the magistrate’s judgement. This may be the case in provinces ruled by more tyrannical barons and counts, or in rural areas where suspects are held until a travelling judge arrives to dispense justice.</p><p>All an accused can do in such circumstances is either lie cunningly, tell a pathetic sob story, or impress the magistrate with their willingness to accept their fate. If the GM allows it, the accused may make a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.exLrBrn2mjb6x2Cq]{Charm}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.0CwV96kTDRF0jUhk]{Entertain (Acting)}, or @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.oMaJZ5cvCJeOUq9H]{Leadership} Test (depending on their chosen tactic), and if they succeed, the presiding magistrate may demonstrate some leniency. This rarely results in them changing their mind about a suspect’s guilt but might move them to consider a lighter punishment.</p><h4>Fairer Hearings</h4><p>In the towns and cities of provinces such as Talabecland, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD]{Reikland}, and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.JournalEntry.PuIrlGBOjxuWpK3P]{Middenheim}, those with power and money can expect a fairer hearing and may hire help from litigants to help them better present their case. Magistrates will still approach a trial with the attitude that they can come to an appropriate ruling before the proceedings but may be willing to listen to argument presented to the court. This is usually only in the case of Characters from the Silver and Gold Tiers or those who can read and write.</p><p>In such cases, a Character can take a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Law)</strong> Test. If the test is successful, the presiding magistrate may be convinced to reconsider their position. If a litigant is hired to help put forward a case, this test may be made using their @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.2LDCVJQWkTFszMok]{Lore (Law)} skill. A typical litigant may be hired to prepare for a case for @Pay[4gc]{4 GC}, and has a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.2LDCVJQWkTFszMok]{Lore (Law)} Skill of 55.</p><p>This test is in addition to the tests allowed in circumstances of rough justice.

The difficulty of the gaol break depends on many factors, but generally the more serious a prisoner’s crimes, the more securely they are locked away.</p><p>Prisoner is being held in a cell at a watch post - <strong>Challenging (+0) Stealth</strong> or S<strong>leight of Hand</strong> Test.</p><p><strong>Held for Moderate Crimes —</strong> Extended <strong>Challenging (+0) Stealth</strong> or <strong>Sleight of Hand</strong> Test to a total of 5 SL.</p><p><strong>Held for Serious Crimes —</strong> Extended <strong>Difficult (-10) Stealth</strong> or <strong>Sleight of Hand</strong> Test to a total of 7 SL.</p><p><strong>Held for Heinous Crimes —</strong> Extended <strong>Hard (-20) Stealth</strong> or <strong>Sleight of Hand</strong> Test to a total of 10 SL.</p><p>If the Test is passed within five Rounds the gaol break is a success, and the imprisoned Character is free. Failure may indicate the the attempt is merely unsuccessful, but an Impressive Failure or worse may indicate that any other Characters involved in the gaol break have been arrested.</p><p>There are ramifications to performing this Endeavour even in the best case scenario. The released prisoner is declared an Outlaw as soon as their absence is noticed. Any Character who assists in their escape may also be outlawed if they are recognised.</p><h4>Notorious Prisons</h4><p>The GM may add further complexity to the gaol break in the case of notorious prisons. Failure may mean that all Chaarcters involved are captured.</p><p><strong>Rijker’s Isle, Marienburg —</strong> A <strong>Hard (-20) Swim, Row</strong> or <strong>Sail</strong> Test must be passed in order to reach the Isle, and again to escape it.</p><p><strong>Mundsen Keep, Altdorf —</strong> Each Character involved in the Endeavour must fight their way past a gaoler (use the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.ykONebW4w2Rd47NX]{Watchman} profile).</p><p><strong>The Middenheim Mining Colony, Middle Mountains —</strong> A <strong>Hard (-20) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test must be passed in order to reach the colony, and again to escape it.</p><h3>Bribery</h3><p>During the legal process there are points when an offer of money might help make the trouble go away. The Watch may be bribed during an arrest, the Prosecution may be bribed during a trial, and the guards may be bribed during incarceration. If an attempt to bribe is made, the GM should consider who it is aimed at and how corruptable they are. The table is representative of most Humans of the Old World.</p><p>An NPC’s Status gives an idea of how much money they require to look the other way, lose paperwork, leave a cell door unlocked, or otherwise act to help a criminal. The total needed depends on the severity of the crime.</p><p><strong>Brass —</strong> [[/r 2d10]] pennies per level. <br /><strong>Silver —</strong> [[/r d10]] shillings per level. <br /><strong>Gold —</strong> 1 gold crown per level.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>@Table[willingness-to-bribe]{Willingness to Take a Bribe}</em></h4><table><tbody><tr style=\"text-align:center\"><td><p><em><strong>1d10</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Integrity</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Price</strong></em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>1 – 2</em></p></td><td><p><em>Incorruptable</em></p></td><td><p><em>Does not take bribes</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>3 – 8</em></p></td><td><p><em>Pliable</em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Trivial:</strong> Status <br /><strong>Moderate:</strong> Status times 3<br /><strong>Serious:</strong> Status times 5<br /><strong>Henious:</strong> Will not take bribes</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>9 – 10</em></p></td><td><p><em>Venal</em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Trivial:</strong> Status <br /><strong>Moderate:</strong> Status times 2 <br /><strong>Serious:</strong> Status times 4<br /><strong>Henious:</strong> Status times 10</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><p><em><strong>Example:</strong> A Watchman (Status Silver 1) being asked to overlook a theft of 2 GC (pilfering: Trivial) who is of Pliable Integrity may accept a bribe of 1D10 Shillings.

        "Outlaws": {
          "name": "Outlaws",
          "text": "<p>Many outlaws in the Empire are fugitives, evading justice when accused of a crime, or escaping after being convicted. Failure to pay taxes or debts can also lead to this fate, especially when the Electors need coin to field an army. The threat of outlawry often convinces those who can’t pay up to join the state troops instead – the nobles get their way by hook or by crook.</p><p>Nobles can declare a resident of their fief an outlaw, although many of them would consider it beneath their station and refer the matter to the nearest court. If the crime is serious, or if the local court and its judges are reputed to be biased or cruel, the accused will often run away to start a new life. Watch sergeants aren’t concerned with pursuing convicts beyond the city walls, and road wardens usually consider their job done after wanted bills are posted. Fugitives are rarely caught, unless the victim or their family can afford to hire a competent bounty hunter.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.xOMceDSC4pxIjQcR]{Outlaws} can be pardoned by reporting for trial and being found not guilty. The Emperor can grant pardons to any citizen of Sigmar’s lands, and Elector Counts are empowered to pardon outlaws within their provinces.</p><h3>Life Outside the Law</h3><p>Outlaws face threat of arrest and imprisonment. The severity of the threat depends on the reach of law enforcement, and the wealth or position of the victims. The wrath of an impoverished baronet from the backwaters of Ostland can often be evaded by travelling to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.JournalEntry.rSRadYoaNXkEq8gs]{Altdorf} and changing your name. Escaping justice after robbing a rich merchant from Nuln is more difficult. Road wardens display wanted posters along the Empire’s thoroughfares, and the reward for your arrest can grow large enough to tempt your own mother.</p><p>Outlaw characters should agree how and where they became outlawed with the GM. If they come within reach of the authorities they crossed, there is a risk of them being recognised. Disguises and a new identity will allay this risk. Most outlaw characters’ background should have an infrequent, moderate impact on the game – it’s fun for it to come up every now and again, but constant pursuit and conflict would interrupt the flow of the game. NPCs finding out about the character’s past provides leverage, or maybe even previously unknown evidence that could prove their innocence…</p><p><strong>Rules:</strong> When returning to a location where an outlaw (allegedly) committed their crimes, make an <strong>Opposed Challenging (+0) Stealth/Perception</strong> Test each day. If this is failed, they have been recognised and the GM can decide the consequences of this. Is the watch tipped off, or is it old friends who notice and are delighted to help the outlaw.</p><h4>Joining an Outlaw Band</h4><p>Finding an outlaw band is hard if they are worth joining! Sharing gossip with villagers in remote areas is a good place to start. If you aren’t particularly notorious, you’ll face an initiation to prove you’re not a spy – usually this involves committing serious crimes, and sometimes receiving a distinctive tattoo or branding.</p><p>Most outlaw bands have rules. In principle, spoils from banditry are to be shared, with the chief receiving a larger share. In practice, members often pocket their loot before it can be divided up. Some outlaw bands impose rules of morality or etiquette, such as only killing targets in cases of necessary self-defence.</p><p>New members are often inspected for diseases and bodily mutation. Outlaw bands may tolerate mutants, but usually want to know about them upfront. Sorcerers are often shunned, as bandits have enough enemies without Witch Hunters chasing them. The leaders of outlaw bands usually require new recruits to disclose their criminal histories and outstanding bounties on their heads.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Vigilante Outlaws</em></h4><p><em>Nobles occasionally declare political dissidents outlawed to silence them. Exiled agitators who flee are rarely pursued for trial once they’ve become someone else’s problem. However, agitators who remain in hiding locally might become vigilantes fighting against the corrupt system — performing acts such as exposing a noble house tainted by the warping touch of Chaos. Nobles who are revealed to be Chaos cultists have no immunity from Sigmar’s witch hunters. Chaos worshipping nobles often hire bounty hunters to kill vigilantes and prevent their dark secrets from being exposed.</em></p><p><em>Vigilante bands often have the sympathy of villagers who provide them with information and aid. In the case of nobles who tax their subjects excessively, vigilante bands might organise peasant revolts or tax wagon heists. Nobles who are reviled for their cruelty must remain constantly on watch for assassination attempts by vigilantes or keep the peace through repressive wardens.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Tactics of Banditry</h3><p><strong>Ambush</strong></p><p>Waiting in ambush by the roadside is a common tactic. Typically, a trap is set to block the road upon a signal from the band’s leader. Hours or even days might pass before wealthy travellers are sighted. Most chiefs are loath to reveal their prime ambush sites for a minor peasant robbery, and merchant caravans usually have armed escorts, so a successful ambush requires waiting patiently for just the right target.</p><p><strong>Rules:</strong> Targets can spot bandits before they’re waylaid by making an <strong>Opposed Challenging (+0) Perception/Stealth</strong> Test. Pit the highest Perception skill among travellers against the bandits’ lowest Stealth. Roadblock traps are resolved with an <strong>Opposed Challenging (+0) Set Trap/Ride</strong> or <strong>Drive</strong> Test between the bandits’ Set Trap skill and the travellers’ Ride or Drive skill (as appropriate). Travellers who managed to spot the ambush receive + 2 SL to any subsequent tests to evade traps.</p><h4>Robbery</h4><p>Robberies involve confronting targets with threats of violence or chasing them and taking their money by force. Ambushes may lead to robberies if the waylaid travellers don’t immediately hand over their valuables after being caught in the trap.</p><p>However, many outlaw bands would rather rove the countryside than lie waiting in the bushes for hours. Robberies can be performed spontaneously, either against wealthy-looking passersby on the highway, or by launching an attack at a roadside coaching inn.</p><p>A robbery often involves violence, but all but the most depraved of outlaws would sooner scare their victims into compliance than risk their own lives in conflict.</p><p><strong>Rules:</strong> Threatening someone into handing over their money requires an Intimidate Test opposed by their Cool skill. As a rough guideline, the target hands over their purse on a success {insert reference to the purse table} and an additional item for further SLs. It might get a bit embarrassing if you succeed well and they start taking off their boots, or cutting the buttons from their coat.</p><p>Player Characters aren’t robbed in this way; instead the bandits’ Intimidate skill causes @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.Ib2YQYChktDFN93y]{Fear}.</p><h3>Outlaws in Downtime</h3><h4>The Income Endeavour</h4><p>Whenever an Outlaw Character takes an @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya.JournalEntryPage.JX9ifRlgzzGrU2zh]{Income Endeavour}, they may decide to either:</p><ul><li><p>Take the money as normal.</p></li><li><p>Take the money as normal and roll on the following table to determine if a further consequence results from their banditry.</p></li></ul><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><p>@Embed[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.tables.RollTable.Hz2aTQ9wNL4CwmCy]{Result}</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/images/outlaw-right.webp\" width=\"200\" /></div><p></p><h3>Forming an Outlaw Band</h3><p>To achieve Tier 3 of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.SrqxyWytyki4WYgC]{Outlaw} career (@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.qXOceBlJefsWFlUI]{Outlaw Chief}), the character must form a band of outlaws. At a minimum, two outlaws in addition to the chief are needed to constitute a band. Existing Characters from your campaign can be recruited, otherwise, outlaw NPCs can be generated using the tables provided below.</p><p>Maintaining an outlaw band while adventuring can be challenging. Outlaws expect their chief to orchestrate regular robberies, and if a band is left without leadership they may find a new chief.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.dH0oByCYNJO4nXTT]{Outlaw Chiefs} can set rules and restrictions for their band.

A good quality camp and stable food supply can improve the outlaw chief ’s Leadership tests by +2 SL. Outlaws are far more likely to wait for the chief to return from adventuring if they’re treated well. The chief normally nominates a second-in-command to oversee the camp during their absences.</p><p></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Outlaws &amp; Ranald</em></h4><p><em>Outlaw bands may venerate Ranald the Deceiver. Where this devotion is significant, they incorporate prayers to Ranald in their initiation rituals, asking the god to judge whether the recruit is dishonest in the right way, rather than merely untrustworthy.</em></p><p><em>Vigilante outlaws often petition Ranald the Protector to champion their cause. Many a vigilante band has sat around the campfire telling rousing tales of Ranald unseating despotic rulers.</em></p><p><em>Outlaws rely on the threat of violence to pull off their crimes, so they find ingenious ways to avoid causing harm without making it obvious to their targets.</em></p><p><em>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.g2vYtD3Mu7ujYTVF]{Bandit Kings} are powerful individuals who like to surround themselves with trusted advisors.

A minimum of two bands is required to constitute a fiefdom. Bandit Kings also require a Lair, which can be anything from a fortified trading post to ruins or caverns, but must be more permanent than a regular camp.</p><p>Bandit Kings rule largely by force of personality and reputation. They almost always adopt colourful pseudonyms and usually earn monikers befitting their character. Bandit Kings can be major players in the criminal underworld despite their more remote base of operation. By placing trusted agents in cities, Bandit Kings can operate smuggling or extortion rings that involve business deals (or sometimes feuds) with urban gangs and crime lords.</p><p>Chiefs who pledge to a Bandit King are often former members of the king’s band. Old collaborators are the most trustworthy because they haven’t betrayed the king in the past. Other chiefs whose camps occupy the king’s lands must be sufficiently impressed or intimidated.</p><p>Of course, chiefs have motives of their own and might leave the Bandit King’s fiefdom or try to usurp him. Bandit Kings are under constant pressure to engage in criminal activities that appeal to their chiefs and keep them on side.</p><p>Keeping a fiefdom stable and loyal means confronting threats beyond bounty hunters or road wardens. Herds of Beastmen, territorial monsters, and tribes of Forest Goblin raiders are no less hostile to outlaw bands than they are to other groups of Humans, and such things are often encountered in the woods of the Empire.</p><h4>Detailing outlaw bands</h4><p>A bandit fiefdom or band can be populated using the tables here. Individual outlaws’ motives can be rolled secretly by the GM so that Outlaw Chiefs must guess their followers’ true drives.</p><p>Less homogenous Outlaw Bands can be generated by making additional rolls to represent various factions within the same band.

Now, in time, a load of Orcs invade his lands and everything’s made a right mess due to their raids and depredations. The Baron’s missus, the Baroness, by rights she oughta send her son after these Orcs, but she don’t, an’ things got worse for the folk.</em></p><p><em>Meantime, there’s this farmer, Bertran’.

She an’ Bertran’ see each other through a window, but can’t do nothing. Meantime, Orcs are still raiding and plundering around the lands, and the rest of the barony’s knights, they lock ‘emselves up in the castle and hide.</em></p><p><em>So, Bertran’ takes charge and gets the commoners together in a great muster of peasants, starts shootin’ some arrers, and scares off the Orcs. ‘Ooo-ray for us, the common folks!</em></p><p><em>Now, there’s these stories about how the Baroness is a really a witch an’ she’s up to no good in the castle, summonin’ daemons and stuff. ‘Er rotten son takes after her, but her daughter, she takes after the brave ol’ Baron.

        "Bounty Hunters": {
          "name": "Bounty Hunters",
          "text": "<p>In the Empire anyone can take on a bounty contract. No licence or guild membership is needed, though established professionals are more likely to win bids for warrants. Veteran hunters receive jobs on reputation alone, while rookies loiter around courthouses looking menacing. Many bounty hunters take other jobs between contracts or travel between the provinces in search of lucrative warrants. Their itinerant, freelancing lifestyle makes the Bounty Hunter career ideal for adventurers.</p><h4>Warrants &amp; Wanted Posters</h4><p>Warrants for the arrest of outlaws are issued by magistrates or nobles. There may also be standing rewards for the slaying of any Goblins, Mutants, or Beastmen though these tend to be for smaller amounts. People may employ bounty hunters without formal warrants, but a hunter who is charged with murder has no recourse if their client denies involvement. Warrants can either be given as private contracts to specific bounty hunters or posted in town squares for public viewing.</p><p>Warrant papers may include a crude sketch of the outlaw to assist in identification by bounty hunters. Descriptions of any distinguishing marks are provided, such as moles, tattoos, or mutations. However, these sketches vary in quality according to the skill of the artist and the reliability of witnesses. Furthermore, some outlaws wear disguises or change their appearances if they know they’re wanted. Bounty Hunters can bid for warrants on contract jobs when there’s competition from other hunters. Judges and nobles don’t always give contracts to the lowest bidder — oftentimes they choose the hunter who’s most likely to catch the outlaw. Though Bounty Hunters often bid on contracts individually, they can also team up with other hunters to bid as a group. Warrants for the arrest of entire outlaw bands are most often taken as group contracts.</p><p>General bounties listed on wanted posters can be claimed by anyone. Capturing or killing the wrong person is illegal when pursuing general warrants, so amateurs often find themselves on the wrong end of the law. Bounty Hunters are in competition to apprehend public outlaws before their peers can, and some even stoop to misdirection or sabotage their rivals. General wanted posters also tend to result in innocent victims being injured by hunters, so they’re usually reserved for the most dangerous outlaws.</p><p>For a guide to typical bounties see the table under @UUID[.vivCjKHAelA7wE5Y#random-warrants]{Random Warrants}.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Conflicts of Jurisdiction</em></h4><p><em>Outlaws who are wanted by multiple courts can be pursued by bounty hunters working for different judges or nobles. Warrants issued by Imperial courts take legal precedence over warrants from Provincial courts. Military and Civil court warrants generally receive lower precedence, although the Imperial Military Court outranks Provincial courts on warrant authority. The rights to arrest an outlaw with multiple outstanding warrants can put bounty hunters at odds with one another.</em></p><p><em>Witch hunters that seek an outlaw for burning may claim Imperial rank over bounty hunters in pursuit of the same target. Bounties are notoriously hard to claim for incinerated bodies though, so it’s a tricky prospect. If the bounty hunter catches and arrests the outlaw first, it’s possible to negotiate a handover in exchange for a written witness statement. A sanctioned witch hunter’s testimony is usually sufficient proof for a Bounty Hunter to claim any reward that’s being offered for a dead outlaw.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Reward Conditions</h4><p>Bounties are only paid if the warrant conditions are met. In many cases outlaws must be captured alive, particularly if they’re wanted for debt evasion or contempt of court. Killing outlaws who are wanted alive can result in being charged with murder. Even if the courts excuse a recklessly violent Bounty Hunter, accidental killings can tarnish the hunter’s reputation.</p><p>Judges and nobles understand that hunting outlaws may result in a final showdown that only one party will survive. Warrants for dangerous convicts are often therefore drafted with separate conditions for returning them dead or alive. In most cases, the reward for capturing outlaws alive is higher, particularly if they possess information that the authorities think could be useful.</p><p>Collecting rewards on dead outlaws requires turning in their heads. These must be sufficiently intact to enable identification by witnesses. If the face was mutilated, then the corpse must be inspected for distinguishing marks. If the body was destroyed the bounty is only awarded if the death was observed by credible witnesses.</p><p>Warrants don’t require the Bounty Hunter to capture or kill the outlaw themself. Authorities that only use Bounty Hunters as trackers or informants offer contracts that involve guiding road wardens to an outlaw camp, or providing information that leads to an arrest. During the arrest, the Bounty Hunter usually observes from a safe distance to be sure the outlaw doesn’t escape.</p><h3>Professional Bounty Hunters</h3><p>Characters in the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.orZTfdJCm6OnUktl]{Bounty Hunter} career begin at Tier 1 (@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.t1TD7YCRFbjiicvi]{Thief-taker}), working as investigators of sorts. They’re not yet sufficiently experienced or well-known to earn warrants from judges. Thief-takers instead work for wealthy clients who’ve had something valuable stolen — perhaps a rare book or family heirloom. Catching the thief is usually of secondary importance to retrieving the stolen goods, and in fact trying to apprehend thieves is technically illegal without a warrant. Protocol requires reporting them to the Watch instead.</p><p>Eventually, Thief-Takers can be introduced to judges and nobles by more experienced bounty hunters. To earn these introductions, Thief-Takers work as spies or hired muscle helping the bounty hunters arrest outlaws or hunt goblins. Those who perform well enough to impress a warrant agent might be given a contract, which usually involves catching a relatively harmless criminal such as a tax evader. Only after completing their first warrant arrest can the Bounty Hunter be considered a professional.</p><p>To enter Tier 2, the Bounty Hunter must have experience of at least one active warrant. Alternatively, the GM may rule that successfully collecting the bounty from a general wanted poster suffices. At this stage most professional bounty hunters are still establishing reputations, bidding against other hunters for low-profile contracts. Veteran hunters can teach the tricks of the trade, but every aspiring bounty hunter is angling to make a high-profile arrest for themselves.</p><p>By Tier 3 (@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.taJXX3aaKZfoNCBs]{Master Bounty Hunter}), warrants can be earned on reputation alone. Judges approach these hardened professionals with enough offers that they can pick and choose. Outlaws begin to recognise them, which makes their job more difficult if they remain in the same city. At Tier 4 (@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.6Abdn6XfJCSI2rWJ]{Bounty Hunter General}), nobles contract the hunter to issue warrants on their behalf and oversee major bounty hunting operations. Bounty Hunter Generals can also become guild masters in certain cities.</p><h3>Tactics of Bounty Hunting</h3><h4>Track</h4><p>Locating an outlaw’s camp or residence is the first step to making an arrest. Bounty Hunters often use bribery to secure this information from local citizens. Next, the Bounty Hunter must observe their target for a while, to ensure it’s the right person.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rules:</strong> @UUID[.6hPtUwOOYBHMsTHK#bribery]{The Bribery rules} can be used to work out if local people are willing to reveal information. If outlaws are particularly beloved by the locals, or if they are particularly cruel and intimidating, it may effect whether or not people are willing to talk. if a bribe is offered subsequent <strong>Gossip</strong> Tests benefit from +2 SL.</p></li></ul><p>Bounty Hunters who’ve successfully identified their mark can sometimes collect a reward simply by reporting the outlaw to authorities. Those with capture-or-kill contracts must instead begin planning the arrest.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rules:</strong> Finding an outlaw’s trail often requires <strong>Gossip</strong> Tests to begin with, then <strong>Track</strong> Tests to determine their exact whereabouts.</p></li></ul><h4>Capture</h4><p>Outlaws that are wanted alive must first be captured. Threats of violence or escalating consequences might convince some outlaws to surrender themselves voluntarily, particularly if their charge is minor or their case is winnable in court. Others turn heel and run, starting a pursuit by the Bounty Hunter. Outlaws facing likely execution by the authorities have nothing to lose by challenging the bounty hunter to combat. The most dangerous outlaws are those who are wanted alive to answer for major crimes.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rules:</strong> The <strong>Intimidate</strong> Test to convince outlaws to surrender is opposed by their <strong>Cool</strong> skill. The difficulty is usually <strong>Very Hard (-30)</strong> but can be reduced to <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong> if the terms are favourable. Outlaws who flee can be chased down with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.MWyxcAft5lonB1mB]{Ranged (Entangling)} weapons.</p></li><li><p>Outlaws who stand and fight may be attacked in melee. Bounty Hunter often employ talents such as @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.jt0DmVK9IiF6Sd2h]{Strike to Stun} to reduce the likelihood that their quarry are killed. Entangling weapons aren’t typically employed when fighting a desperate outlaw.</p></li></ul><h4>Kill</h4><p>The major requirement for collecting the bounty on an outlaw who’s wanted dead is their intact head. Bounty Hunters usually decide whether to capture outlaws alive or dead before the final showdown, but they must sometimes assess an evolving situation and change their minds. Obviously living long enough to take up another warrant is better than trying to fulfil a current one.</p><p>There is no code of honour requiring bounty hunters to fight fairly. Ranged strikes, concealed weapons, and poison are all on the table. Attacks usually target outlaws’ bodies and limbs, while headshots are avoided at all costs.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rules:</strong> Normal combat rules are used for killing outlaws. Body and limb locations can be targeted with called shots at -20 to-hit, or by using the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.GU1KpgY3MeFIaDaq]{Careful Strike} talent.</p></li><li><p>Heads can be severed from corpses without rolling dice. Critical Hit table descriptions determine the condition of the outlaw’s head for identification by court authorities.</p></li></ul><h4>Bounty Hunter Guilds</h4><p>Bounty hunters aren’t typically represented by guilds in the Empire — they are independent contractors working for the courts. Bounty hunters’ fortunes rise and fall with their track records. Several botched jobs can leave them without money or employment prospects. There are, however, bounty hunter guilds in Tilea and a few southern Empire cities. Nuln hosts a guild consisting primarily of Tilean hunters, and Averland has several guilds that regulate bounty-hunting missions into the Border Princes.</p><p>Bounty hunter guilds advocate for their members in disputes with warrant agents. Guilds rarely involve themselves in murder trials, however, and will revoke membership from bounty hunters who kill innocents.</p><p>The primary purpose of guilds is to manage and regulate the issuing of arrest warrants. The guild master is known as a Bounty Hunter General. Bounty Hunter Generals are also employed privately by nobles across the Empire, usually on short-term contracts, to manage purges of bandit fiefdoms.</p><p>Independent hunters are allowed to bid for warrants in cities with guilds (though members usually receive the most lucrative contracts). However, only guild members are allowed to claim bounties from general wanted posters in these cities. This restriction is intended to reduce chaotic free-for-all hunting competitions between independents and guild members. The charge for illegally arresting an outlaw is either assault or kidnapping. The charge for illegally killing an outlaw is murder.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Lone Hunters and Teams</em></h4><p><em>Bounty Hunters usually operate solo while in pursuit of individual outlaws, primarily to maximise their profits. The ability to catch an outlaw by oneself also marks the hunter as a true professional, particularly if the outlaw is very dangerous. When chasing an outlaw band, however, only the most seasoned bounty hunters work alone. Teaming up with other bounty hunters to split the reward for catching an outlaw band is a routine practice and isn’t considered cowardly in the slightest.</em></p><p><em>Bounty-hunting teams can be composed of multiple professional hunters with separate warrants from the same court, or the hunters can share a group contract. Another common practice is for lone bounty hunters to hire thief-takers or mercenaries to assist them with a group arrest. This latter arrangement is risky for the bounty hunter, however, because mercenaries expect payment regardless of whether the outlaws are caught. Teams are typically disbanded after each job, but they might reunite again if the need arises.</em></p></blockquote><p>Bounty Hunter Generals scrutinise independent hunters working in the same region as their own contractors. Local hunters often accuse visiting independents of interference or reckless practices.</p><p>Usually, a firm warning from the Bounty Hunter General is enough to send independents packing to another city, or bring them into the guild. Many bounty hunters are loath to join guilds because they are lone wolves by nature.</p><h4>Random Warrants</h4><p>Bounty Hunter warrants and contracts can be generated using this table. Bounty hunters can source multiple contract opportunities from the same (or different) agents by loitering around a courthouse and making a <strong>Challenging (+0) Gossip</strong> Test. The number of warrants available is equal to +SL.</p><p>GMs are encouraged to design warrants tailored to the storyline of their campaign by handpicking suitable results from the table. GMs may prefer to consider choosing the reward according to the outlaw’s crimes.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-2rvS1MEXaGObefpv\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Unwarranted</h3><p>Wilhelm Wulfwitz is a bounty hunter active in Altdorf. He is looking for assistants to help him track down an outlaw known as Jurgen Krast, who is said to be hiding out in the Reikwald near Fielbach. In fact, there is no Jurgen Krast, but those wandering the Reikwald near Fielbach will encounter swathes of Spiderclaw Forest Goblins. The outlaw and the reward are just fabrications by those hoping the eager Bounty Hunters will sort out their goblin problem.

Brunner is not the most reliable companion, however. He will do whatever is necessary to fulfil a mission, even using party members as bait to lure outlaws or distract monsters.</p><h4>Extra Warrants</h4><p>After Brunner has accepted a warrant, he always fulfils it himself. However, Brunner’s services are in such high demand that he can’t possibly accept every contract that he’s offered. Bounty hunter characters who encounter Brunner at a courthouse or tavern can recognise him with a <strong>Lore (Local)</strong> Test. If they buy him a drink, Brunner might give them advice on available warrants that he turned down. </p><p>He is not a Bounty Hunter General who distributes warrants via subcontract or commission, but instead connects other hunters with hiring warrant officers. Brunner only assists other hunters with their arrests if doing so somehow serves his own interests.</p><p>The Black Prince</p><p>Possibly the most notorious bandit king in the Old World was a mysterious figure known as the Black Prince. Bounty hunters believed the prince and his alleged bounty of 5000 GC was just a folktale until Brunner tracked him down. The Black Prince’s real identity was Dralaith, a fearsome Dark Elf warrior who’d established a stronghold in the Grey Mountains after raiding Bretonnia. </p><p>His small army of Beastmen, Dark Elves, and other creatures terrorised the surrounding lands for years. Despite Brunner defeating the Black Prince, he failed to kill him, and the head that he recovered was another Druchii. Dralaith has been on the run ever since. Any rumours of the Black Prince resurfacing will attract Brunner’s interest.</p><h3>Nemesis Encounters</h3><p>Characters wanted by Brunner are in serious trouble. He will track them down eventually, and there will be a reckoning. Brunner is an ideal nemesis for adventuring parties that take a special delight in breaking the law. Individual Outlaw characters should only be hunted by Brunner if they’re Tier 3 or 4.</p><h4>Judge Vaulkberg</h4><p>Brunner receives his most lucrative warrants from a travelling magistrate called Judge Vaulkberg. Sentences are delivered with relish by Vaulkberg, who administers the harshest possible punishments for every crime. His personal executioner is an Ogre who can tear limbs from a condemned man. </p><p>Though Vaulkberg is based in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.JournalEntry.rSRadYoaNXkEq8gs]{Altdorf} where he oversees a team of skilled torturers at the Reiksfang prison, he also tours smaller towns and villages across the Reikland. Nearly any convicted party can therefore find itself at his mercy if the GM is feeling cruel. However, Brunner will generally only pursue parties that escape Vaulkberg’s custody if their crime was serious enough to earn a bounty of at least 20 GC.</p><h4>The Price of Infamy</h4><p>Any party that becomes sufficiently notorious can find itself hunted by Brunner. If the party is very powerful, Brunner will hire NPC bounty hunters and/or persuade other adventurers to assist him. The only way to shake Brunner is by providing material evidence that the party’s accuser was corrupt. </p><p>Brunner hates corrupt nobles and sometimes pursues them without pay. On occasion, Brunner teams up with outlaws that he was originally hired to arrest to apprehend a more dangerous villain. Once the villain has been caught however, and the outlaw’s services are no longer needed, Brunner brings both of them to justice.</p>"

These tales are largely fictitious – the lone rogue is almost never alone, and organised crime is anything but romantic.</p><p>Many criminal schemes need a range of specialist skills to pull off, so cooperation is essential and crime gangs can be found in every major settlement in the Old World. The profits of large or rich territories can fund the growth of immensely powerful gangs with real influence and resources. Organised gangs often discourage other criminals in such places. To maintain their own activities without interruption, they need crime to rank below other challenges to the local rulers. They ruthlessly control criminal activities, eliminating anyone who might prove an effective rival or draw the attention of the watch. The sudden appearance of Big Piet de Groot in a dark Marienburg alley is terrifying, and not just because of his tall and muscular frame. Just as dangerous are the hundred other ruthless men and women whose influence permeates the docks and counting houses of the city.</p><p>However, the potential rewards tempt individuals to get away with more than their share of the loot, murder their rivals, or rat out erstwhile partners to the authorities. Potential betrayals make everyone nervous, so the unwritten code of honour among thieves is enforced with lethal violence.

The ringleaders of the Hooks and the Fish decry the crimes, just as they secretly yearn to find the Kid. Such a talented individual could be put to their use.</em></p><p><em>For nobles and merchants who can afford to lose a purse or two, becoming the Kid’s victim is a small honour, a chance to boast and spin a yarn about the incident. Leather-workers and locksmiths love the Kid, who creates a market for expensive locked wallets, folders, and reticules (though the Kid has proved adept at pinching and using the keys).</em></p><p><em>Others are not so impressed: the witch hunter who lost his pouch containing essential evidence; the librarian relieved of a key; the lover deprived of a sweetheart’s scented handkercher and love letter; the wizard suddenly without a vital spell ingredient. Such incidents suggest the Kid is not a mere opportunist after coin, but someone who also works for hire.</em></p><p><em>Is the Kid a boy or a girl? Short hair or long, tidy or tousled, and what colour? Smartly dressed or clad in rags? Most insist on a filthy urchin, a dark-haired, barefoot boy, but others disagree.

          "text": "<p>Whilst all organisations would declare the mutual benefits of membership, unheard of is the leader who forms an organisation without some personal benefit to himself. Since only a masochist would take enjoyment from shepherding a mob of habitual lying, cynical, self-motivated lawbreakers, it’s no surprise that the lion’s share of the organisation’s benefits come to the man or woman in charge.</p><h3>Paying Your Dues</h3><p>An organisation, especially one operated by thieves and charlatans cannot be run on good will alone, and will, in some form or other, collect a fee from its members. This might be a one-off payment to gain admittance, a monthly or yearly membership fee, or a percentage cut of the rewards of its members’ activities (and maybe all of the above). This may depend on the size of the activities, if it brings additional heat on other members, if it requires active protection from the organisation, and the member’s standing.</p><p>Generally speaking, a criminal must pay 1 coin determined by their status for every level of the gang to which they belong, per month. So a Thief (Brass 3) who is a member of the Essen Black Rose Lodge (Level 3) must pay three pennies a month.</p><p>While those near the top of the organisation may have the larger enterprises, they pay far less, relatively speaking, than those below them. The organisation may operate like a feudal hierarchy, where leaders collect from those within their territory, and, in turn, pass a portion of that up the chain, or it may act like a social club, with each man responsible for paying his dues directly to the leaders’ enforcers.</p><h3>Marking Your Territory</h3><p>One of the most important tasks of a criminal organisation is to regulate and coordinate criminal activity within a region, to avoid over-farming of certain targets, or even worse, attacks by one member of the organisation upon those owned or under the protection of another. As organisations get larger, they will subdivide their territory amongst a number of underbosses and ringleaders, responsible for overseeing the organisation’s operations within that region.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Black Rose Lodges</em></h4><p><em>In the far eastern expanse of Stirland, beyond the Haunted Hills and Hunger Wood, lies the cursed lands of Sylvania. Legally under the auspices of the Elector Count of Stirland, for long stretches of its history darker powers have ruled over these lands. Many attempts to exert lawful rule have faltered, both in fear of, and under direct conflict with the unliving, as well as through common corruption and incompetence. One particular attempt to exert Imperial Law has in part succeeded, if not as intended.</em></p><p><em>Twenty years ago, the elector of Stirland, determined that securing the roads to allow trade and transport to flow would perhaps be a suitable first step to taming the lost land. The task was given to Captain Otto Friedle of the 14th Stirland Expeditionary Force. Given the grimness of the task, he sought the toughest and meanest he could find, those willing to do things others weren’t, including obtaining pardons for incarcerated soldiers, promising them their freedom for service. The force was formed into ‘Lodges’ deployed in mounted units at roadside taverns along the Sylvanian border, where they could ride out to support and protect travellers or react to threats.</em></p><p><em>While in principle it worked, the Expeditionary Force, dubbed the ‘Black Rose Men’ for its adoption of Morrite symbolism, were quick to realise a much more lucrative approach would be to sever their official ties, and provide protection directly to those travelling the cursed lands. The Black Rose Men still perform much of what the Elector Count had hoped, though they now supplement their income through criminal enterprises. Their main business is smuggling, in particular goods found only in the depths of Sylvania, including the grimoires and ritual artefacts of forbidden necromancy, but also freely engage in horse theft, kidnapping, and extortion. </em></p><p><em>The organisation is split into five localised chapters, each with their own symbology tattooed on their horses and worn as patches on their jackets. Like their name, these symbols often reflect the chilling regalia of Morr’s cult, grinning skulls, perching ravens, the hourglass, and the balck rose. Despite still being head of the Seigfriedhof chapter, Friedle does not claim overall dominion of the organisation. In theory, the head of each chapter treats the others as equals, though in recent years, the head of the Essen chapter, Emerson Barghest, has come closest to being a spokesperson for the entire organisation.</em></p><p><em>The Seigfriedhof Lodge - Organisation Level 2 </em></p><p><em>The Essen Lodge - Organisation Level 3</em></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>Albrecht ‘The Fish’</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.oO7SkE9Ce6LY2zCn]</p><p>His nickname coming from his former membership in the gang that rules half the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.JournalEntry.rSRadYoaNXkEq8gs]{Altdorf} docklands, Albrecht is a wiry man, with mean eyes and a perpetual sneer. A native Wastelander, he left for the capital of the Empire in his late teens. Even then, he was a rising star within the ‘Guild We’ve Never Heard Of ’ and was sent to oversee their interests in Altdorf. He does not talk of what caused his return to Marienburg two decades later, but the tattoo of a bloody dagger inscribed over the gaping fish tattoo on the left side of his neck implies a dramatic parting of ways. That said, he still has extensive contacts in Altdorf and beyond, and appears to hold a position of authority over the small gang of Fish members operating in Marienburg. His connections have proven invaluable, as he is able to lay his hands on many rare (and illegal) products through his network of acquaintances, including the valuable and addictive @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.qfd01sggD9xbCuJY]{Black Lotus}.</p><p>Albrecht is familiar with all the vices that plague the lower classes, and he can either provide them or make contact with someone who can. He is violent and possesses no sense of pity. He does not partake of his own merchandise, viewing the dealers and addicts he sells to as weaklings, and does little to disguise his scorn. Those who rely on his supplies of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.5fowsr8vslorjeB2]{Mandrake} or Crimson Shade are cut off without a moment of consideration if they can no longer pay his prices. Likewise, tradesmen who back out of even the smallest deal face bloody retribution.</p><p>Albrecht has made himself a trusted ally of Adalbert Henschmann of the League of Gentlemen Entrepeneurs. However, but he is not content to serve as a middleman for much longer. His eye is on a much larger prize. He has built a strong alliance with the dangerous Grossbart — an influential member of the League’s Inner Circle who is eager to exercise greater power in time to come.</p><p>While Albrecht’s ultimate goal is to unseat Henschmann himself, his sights are currently aimed squarely at the Kislevite apothecary, Dmitri Hrodovsky. Between the two of them, they account for almost three-quarters of the city’s imports of Weirdroot, Ranald’s Delight, and Mandrake Root. It is Albrecht, supported by Grossbart’s loathsome influence, who is setting up a move by an Estalian racketeer, Miguelito Nunez, to dominate the trade, and eliminate other sources of Black Lotus in the city. If this operation succeeds Albrecht plans to marginalise the Kislevite, after which he believes his position in the underworld will become utterly unassailable.</p><h3>Gunna von Sperren ‘The Smuggler Queen of Nordland’</h3><p>@Embed[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.actors.Actor.Qw13I1LPhwjtAVp6]</p><p>From her grandiose mansion in the Norsaugen ward of Hargendorf, the Smuggler Queen presides, the imperious mistress of a complex web of smuggling bands, trafficking gangs, and wreckers. Contraband rarely lands on the Nordland shore without her blessing… and a hefty donation to her coffers.</p><p>Gunna von Sperren grew up gutting fish in Hargendorf ’s Seegabe Market. She was always shrewd, ambitious, and amoral — before her 18th birthday, she blackmailed her way into marriage with the ageing Elmer von Sperren, who ran a small trading concern shipping cargo for House Akkerman of Marienburg. As the respectable wife of a merchant, Gunna slowly assembled her criminal empire before Elmer was killed by a large sea scorpion that had somehow made it into his bedchamber.</p><p>A buyer can obtain almost anything from the Smuggler Queen with enough gold. Her enterprise is principally seven smuggling rings, each overseen by one of her adult children. These gangs secure and beach contraband, conceal it from the authorities, and ensure safe passage through the Empire in innocuous carts and barges. Several gangs import taxed or restricted goods, such as Bretonnian brandy, into the Empire, while another deals in exotic herbs and items stolen from the Laurelorn Forest. A smuggling ring organised by her eldest daughter Edelyn work with House Akkerman’s darkest contacts in Marienburg, such as a supplier of Black Lotus known to them only as ‘the Lascar’. He wishes to forge a connection to Gunna to source illicit and corrupting artefacts. The vicious son Esben deals personally with shadowed figures in the sewers under Erengrad, who desire living captives to transport to places unknown. For more details of these operations, see @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-salzenmund.journals.JournalEntry.oijzlcgtcrCiH1PM.JournalEntryPage.XAm5SpjUV9Pon4UI]{Smuggling Rings}.</p><p>Nobody forgets a visit to Gunna von Sperren’s ‘court’ in Hargendorf. Minstrels play genteel airs, while her children mingle with accomplished sea captains and several of the cowed von Hargenfels family, who nominally rule the Barony. The Queen is known for her superior manner, referring to herself as the royal ‘we’ and rarely deigning to talk with anyone she deems inferior. She dresses in costly attire more suited to Reikland nobility than a Nordland crime boss. Accompanying von Sperran is her pet Hyenadon, taken from a wrecked Bretonnian galley returning from Lustria.</p>"

          "text": "<p>While there are activities a criminal can engage in, some activities are beyond a solo operator. This could be due to too many specialised tasks for one person to handle, or vulnerability to fellow criminals or the law that they’d be exposed to without help.</p><h3>Protection Rackets</h3><p>Small traders are easy targets for thieves. While galling to the merchant, a means of security is to pay thieves directly. Such payments only protect merchants from those they have paid. If a district is controlled by an organisation, this can become an efficient means of protection. Once paid, members are told which places are off-limits. As failure to provide protection devalues the gang’s reputation, the punishment for those who break the injunction is harsh.</p><h3>Smuggling</h3><p>There are many forms of smuggling, from the movement of illegal or proscribed goods, to the evasion of tariffs on the mundane goods. Whilst the actual act of smuggling is a suitable enterprise for a lone operator, there is more to smuggling than moving a crate in the dead of night. Depending on the size and regularity of cargo, there are people involved in the loading and unloading, the storage of, not to mention negotiating with corrupt excisemen to obtain legitimate paperwork if the goods need to be moved on again. </p><p>Smuggling operations involving the movement of contraband, such as Black Lotus or Bretonnian brandy, are only profitable if it is moved in bulk. Safe locations where the product can be stored or rendered from raw materials into its finished form, are also required. </p><h3>Entertainments</h3><p>Vast sums of money change hands between those who place wagers at places such as gambling dens, sporting arenas, or fighting pits. The people near the top of a criminal organisation frequently need places to hide their money, and such locations are perfect for doing so. Creative accounting can hide illicit funds within the normal, legal, flow of cash. Furthermore such locations make for ideal meeting places. If that wasn’t reason enough to control such locations, these are exactly the sorts of places thieves like to spend their ill-gotten gains, so it benefits the organisation to have their people spending money in their own businesses.</p>"

Even incorruptable members of the watch may find themselves surrounded by enemies, some wearing the same uniform they are. Bribery is rife, but there are other reasons a watchman might look the other way. Often watchmen have grown up on the streets they patrol — criminals know them … and their loved ones.</p><p>The watch may not have the manpower to oppose an organisation, or they may know their chances of recovering stolen property are slim, which can affect motivation when dealing with petty crimes. The law might lay off certain members and locations, leaving the organisation to run certain operations without interruption. In return, the organisation shows restraint, avoids messing with those who have influence to put pressure on the watch, and even handing over members whose actions are so egregious that the watch cannot turn a blind eye.</p><h3>Guilds</h3><p>Poor merchants are not able to afford losses to regular thievery, so seeking protection may be the most expedient route to protect their goods. The richer the merchant, the easier they can weather small losses. Conversely, they are less predisposed towards seeking agreements for protection. A rich merchant family may resent goods being stolen due to the resulting loss of face as much as their financial value. In order to preserve their perception of power, they may spend many times the potential losses to fund their own private protection. </p><p>In large cities a number of different trade and professional guilds exist with the goal of protecting its members. In fact, some criminal organisations may have started as professional guilds; particularly in coastal cities, there is a significant overlap between dockworkers and criminal guilds. A criminal organisation may be so embroiled in guild business that there is little to differentiate the criminal and legitimate organisations. Certain businesses are already intrinsically linked to crime, or their activities fulfil an organisation’s needs. Businesses can double as fronts or gathering places, or as a means to conceal large amounts of loose coinage. In certain segments of a city, the vendors have never seen a gold crown, so a man carrying several hundred of them will arouse suspicion.</p>"

Whilst the obvious advantage is avoiding being chained to an anchor and thrown into the Reik, there are a considerable number of benefits that aren’t available to a solo operator.</p><h3>Training and Specialist Help</h3><p>A gang can put members in touch with specialists whose membership should ensure they can be trusted not to double-cross a rogue mid-heist. A plan might require a decoy or distraction, or a lookout. In such a case, an organisation’s roster makes for a better bet than trawling dodgy taverns for suitable accomplices. An organisation’s Contacts can be invaluable after a job too — when the watch are searching for a rogue shot twice as he escaped across a rooftop, being able to seek the ministrations of a trusted barber surgeon can avoid having to answer awkward questions at the temple of Shallya.</p><h3>News and Rumours</h3><p>Within a large organisation there will be information brokers — folk who have positioned themselves to collect information on the people of the city and their activities, which they can pass on for a fee or favour to those trusted to keep the source of their information a secret.</p><p>Even if a rogue is confident in his own ability to carry out a crime, the organisation can still provide information that the rogue might struggle to obtain. They could provide plans showing sewer networks or secret passages beneath a manor, a schedule of Watch patrols, pre-copied keys to government buildings, or contacts within those buildings who can be convinced to leave a door unlocked or guard dog in its kennel.</p><h3>Fencing</h3><p>A successful rogue may obtain all kinds of objects they can’t value. A thief may make away with swag including a jade statuette of a frog (a worthless imitation), a crystal decanter (a gift from the Ambassador of Lothern worth a small fortune), and a crude stone carving (antique Unberogen, worth significant amounts to a collector).</p><p>A skilled fence can accurately value finds and keeps contact with specialists who may not be criminals, but who aren’t terribly ethical either. A rogue with access to such specialists can earn considerably more of an item’s true value than one who does not. Beyond the esoteric, a fence is an efficient way of getting ‘hot’ property off a thief ’s hands quickly. If a particular item of note has been stolen, or if a person with significant influence was the target, a rogue would be wise to get the object out of town fast, and a fence is the best means to achieve this.</p><h3>Protection From The Law</h3><p>It’s a fact of life that criminals occasionally get caught. A gang member might provide valuable information to the watch, so it obviously behoves the gang to spring such members out of a watch post cell as quickly as possible. The gang may well have members of the watch on the payroll, able to assist a minor gang member go free. However, this cuts (sometimes literally) both ways — if the captured member is not worth the cost and time to be extracted legally from the authorities, a more immediate form of silencing them might be preferred.</p><p>The support a criminal organisation is willing to give to a member who is convicted of a crime varies according to its size, and the seriousness of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dslf.journals.JournalEntry.Aw8mrNpme6izrwih.JournalEntryPage.FnHkl070RbY6zUDj]{crime committed}.

The main conduit for smuggling operations are home to the kinds of people predisposed to join a criminal organisation. In Altdorf, the reverse is true, and it is the dockland gangs that grew in strength and power, becoming the principal criminal organisations in the city.</em></p><p><em>Both organisations are based in Altdorf’s East End, the lower-class neighbourhood sandwiched between the River Talabec and the Reik. An outsider would expect the mutual heritage to create two very similar organisations, but the Hooks and Fish are very different. The Hooks, under the strong hand of Willi Pick, have become over the last 30 years a strong unit, focused and ruthless. Despite their criminal nature, the Hooks have established themselves as a force of order (if not law), and in recent history have fought side by side with the Watch to restore order to the city during periods of civil unrest.</em></p><p><em>Conversely, the Fish, eschewing a figurehead, are more fractured in direction and beliefs. Whilst the Hooks have established an air of legitimacy, the same could not be said of the Fish. Recent bad judgement saw them join in alliance with an anarchist movement led by a servant of the dark powers. While this damaged the Fish’s position, they have managed to recover, and cemented their place as supportive to the capital’s Revolutionary Movements. In addition, the Fish’s more fractured nature has led to the appearance of cells appearing in other cities along the Reik and Talabec. While some of these may be individuals seeking to trade on the Fish name, the normally psychotic response to those wearing their trademark tattoos without permission, indicates at least some of these organisations are legitimate cells of the Fish.</em></p><p><em>The Hooks - Organisation Level 4</em></p><p><em>The Fish - Organisation Level 3 in Altdorf, and 2 where it is getting established elsewhere</em></p></blockquote><h3>The Cult of Ranald</h3><p>If one god’s worship was welcome in a criminal organisation, surely it would be Ranald’s? Nearly all thieves offer prayers to Ranald to bless their caper, the relationship between its priesthood and the heads of organised gangs is a complicated matter. Despite his patronage of the thief and rogue, Ranald’s Cult believes strongly in freedom from tyranny and liberation of the individual from the oppression of despotic rulers. Unfortunately, rulers rarely get more despotic than those found at the heart of a criminal organisation.</p><p>To a devotee of the Cult of Ranald, the violence required by criminal organisations is sickening. The cult embraces theft as an art form, yet criminal organisations pursue it as a bloody business. No sincere Ranaldan would happily work for those who resort to bloodshed, no matter how much they offered in terms of a cut of the loot.</p><p>For devotees of Ranald, membership of a criminal gang is intolerable, and they find ways to escape the organisation. Such is the case of the charlatan Kurt von Shent, a member of the League of Gentlemen Entrepreneurs during Hugo Delftgruber’s rule. Conscious of the brutal regime Henschmann would create, he adopted a new guise as Hans von Kleptor. Over time he became the most important Ranaldan priest at Marienburg’s Gilt House Temple. As a follower of Ranald’s strictures, he intends to unite the various facets of Ranald’s cult in Marienburg as a counter to Henschmann’s criminal regime.</p><h3>Criminals and Other Gods</h3><p>Whilst those who engage in organised crime must indulge in antisocial activity to pursue their livelihood, this does not mean they are impious. Many organised criminals make a show of respecting the gods, wearing symbols of Sigmar or Ulric like other citizens of the Empire. Crime lords may bequeath generous donations to shrines in the poorer parts of town. The ringleaders of criminal gangs can be sincere believers, even miracle-working priests.</p><p>In Altdorf, the Hooks engage in extortion and smuggling but hide their criminal face behind a respectable mask. Their members work hard on the docks during the day, attend Festag musters at temples of Sigmar, and patrol the streets alongside the watch in times of unrest. Their leader, Willi Pick, positions himself to be seen standing proudly as a parade of Sigmarite knights passes by and conspicuously drops generous handfuls of gold crowns into the poor box at the Temple of Shallya.</p><p>The Fish abide by the principle that anything the Hooks do, they do not. Few senior Fish make displays of piety, paying as little respect as possible without drawing accusations of blasphemy. They regard the pious pose of Willi Pick with contempt, pointing out that his patronage of the cult of Shallya is a hypocritical ruse intended to mollify the very people that the Hooks prey upon at night.</p><p>Certain crime lords resort to invoking the dreaded powers of Chaos, but such folk are rare. Even the most criminally depraved of the Empire’s citizens are raised to hate and fear the ruinous powers and knows that resorting to their worship would draw the righteous outrage of their fellow citizens, from mobs of impoverished slum dwellers to the Witch Hunters of the Order of the Silver Hammer.</p><h3>Gang War</h3><p>A common trait amongst criminals is the desire for more than they can take for themselves. So, it is no surprise that within a criminal organisation, there will be numerous individuals dissatisfied with their position. Whilst promotion by merit is possible, the natural inclination for such individuals will be to obtain promotion by force. The hardest thing for any criminal organisation is to keep it from erupting into war within itself.</p><p>On the streets of Altdorf the ramifications of the Fog Riots of 2506 IC are still being felt. The Hooks play a careful game, assisting the watch by placing their members within the Citizens Vigilance Committee. Whilst their public face is of law-abiding virtue, they prepare to muscle in on any of the Fish’s smuggling operations they can seize. For their part, the Fish are friable; a prospective leader would have to crack their rivals’ heads in order to wrest control of the gang. If they did, the vast smuggling network of the Fish, with offshoots in many cities along the Reik and Talabec, would be theirs for the taking.</p><p>In Middenheim, the Low Kings are mostly satisfied to stick to their territories. The rookeries of Ostwald and the Altquartier provide more than enough work for the larger gangs, and the smaller ones are humble enough to confine their activities to their own districts. However, Bleyden, the Lowest King, is growing old and shedding allies, making his holdings a tempting target for takeover.</p><p>In Marienburg, things are more stable, but trouble is brewing. Despite the best efforts of the Gentlemen Entrepreneurs, the first moves of a coming gang war are already being plotted by Grossbart and his allies.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar parchment\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Urban Myths<br />Johann the Knife</em></h4><p><em>A bright morning to ye!

The distance covered in a Stage can vary greatly depending on the terrain, the urgency, and the method of transport.</p><p>The distances in the table might not sound very long, especially compared to those mentioned in the <strong>WFRP Core Rulebook</strong>, but the journey is assumed to be off-road and to involve pauses to rest, to take stock of the terrain, to make notes or sketch maps, to take minor detours, and to backtrack when the route is unclear, and accommodates hunting, foraging, and the execution of other Endeavours.</p><p>It also leaves time for making a proper camp at the end of the day. A party ignoring many of these requirements can certainly go faster, as reflected in the Haste Endeavour.</p><p>The distance to the next stage can be based on the following table. Note that values have been rounded to the nearest 0.5 for convenience, which does make certain smaller values look disproportionate to larger values. The numbers represent good going in moderate weather conditions, and the GM should decide for themselves how many miles are travelled before a stage is complete.</p><p>The travel distances given in the table assume that a route is being plotted to keep the going reasonably comfortable for the terrain type, with some occasional difficult obstacles when they are unavoidable.</p><p>Bear in mind, that this will often involve winding and circuitous routes and so the distances travelled will not be as the crow flies. Some of the more difficult routes will preclude the use of carts, and sometimes even horses.</p><h4>Provisions</h4><p>Wilderness travel can turn disasterous if provisions run out. When travelling it is important to keep track of provisions, such as water, food, and animal fodder. Unlike travel along roads, where regular stops at coaching inns provide a chance to replenish stocks, more food can only be found by taking @UUID[.w5XYNzkXObxeBzFD#hunt-(or-fish)-endeavour]{Hunt, Fish}, or @UUID[.w5XYNzkXObxeBzFD#forage-endeavour]{Forage} Endeavours.</p>"

          "text": "<p>The party may be forced into the wilderness at short notice and have to find their way without preparation. If the Characters set out on a journey without adequate preparation and find themselves exposed to the elements, with insufficient food, they deserve to be made to feel miserable. If the party can afford to go for quality items, they should be made to feel good about their choices.</p><h4>Animals</h4><p>If the party are using mounts or pack animals then they should not forget these need care and food. After a day’s hard travel, a horse needs more than being tied up by a patch of grass to keep it healthy and energised for the next day. The owner needs to bring along good fodder or seek it out on the journey. Each pack or riding animal will need at least four times as much water as a human.</p><h4>Fire</h4><p>In wet conditions making a fire becomes difficult. A tinderbox is a prudent purchase.</p><h4>Packs and Containers</h4><p>Carrying things efficiently is important and versatile baggage will reduce the encumbrance of other items and give quicker access to their contents when they are needed in a hurry. Water-carrying equipment will often be vital and should be considered carefully. Again, waterproofing and protection are important. No one wants to find their matches have got wet or their food spoiled because it got too hot in the sun. Blackpowder may be compromised through exposure to either hot or wet conditions.</p><h4>Clothing</h4><p>A decent set of walking boots is a requirement for most Characters. A cloak or coat is a must as well. It rains often in the Empire, and it can be an even more dismal place than usual if you are soaked to the skin. Decent warm clothes and gloves are important in cold weather.</p><h4>Food and Water</h4><p>This is a priority. Some parties will be confident of being able to find enough food as they go, especially one with skilled hunters. However, it is always prudent to stock up on rations for emergencies and bad hunting days.</p><p>Every person in the party requires enough for one person per day of the journey. With a large party on a long journey, this can start to add up. Food reserves should be selected precisely because they will last a long time. Dried beans, grains, and nuts work well and require little preparation. Salted meats, pickled vegetables, and candied fruit all last a lot longer than their unprocessed equivalents.</p><p>Water is heavy and bulky, so thought might be required for its transport. In water-rich areas a single skin is all anyone requires, and Characters can fill up whenever it’s convenient. The more arid the land, and the further between each water source, the more water needs to be carried, and the hotter it is, the more water is required per person, per day. In the swamps of the Reikland, such as the Oberschlecht or Furdienst, water may be abundant, but it is peaty and unpotable.</p><h4>Tents</h4><p>The shelter afforded by a good tent can make all the difference to a good night’s sleep and have the party fit for the next day’s travel. Having tents will mean Make Camp Endeavours become Average instead of Challenging. Making a shelter is not the only factor in making a good camp but having tents will help considerably.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar parchment\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Poor Planning and its Consequences</em></h4><p><em>If Characters fail to plan properly there are two common outcomes to their disadvantage. The first is that they may suffer from adverse environmental conditions, as described under the effects of weather. The second is that they may suffer shortfalls. A list of common shortfalls and their effects is given in @UUID[.M0ErxS6tPnwsFsRb#consequences-of-shortfalls]{Consequences of Shortfalls}.

The oldest of these structures are waystones, erected by the Elves to help funnel magical energy towards the Great Vortex at the centre of Ulthuan. The oldest of these date back to -4420 IC. Few Humans understand their import, though they know better than to tamper with them as the magical energy that courses through them can be dangerous.</p><p>The Belthani, as the earliest human settlers of the Old World are termed, gleaned a little of the purpose and function of waystones, and set up their own magical stones, known as Oghams, to contain foul magical within their perimeters or power their own Hedgecraft rituals.</p><p>Monoliths have been erected for ceremonial purposes, to track the movement of the sun and stars, or mark the site of a grave.

This can reflect the thought that goes into deciding what to bring on the journey, but it can also involve research about the terrain, its inhabitants, and the destination. It can throw up hints about what might be encountered, where to procure maps and journals, the requirement for NPCs with useful skills, and insight into local customs.</p><p>Provided the Characters have access to charts or journals from those who have undertaken the journey before, or experienced travellers who have travelled the route, each member of the party may take a <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test or <strong>Challenging (+0) Research</strong> Test. Every SL can be traded for one of the following benefits during the subsequent journey:</p><ul><li><p>Ask the GM to reroll a Travel Event. The result of the second roll must be accepted, even if it is less desirable than the first result.</p></li><li><p>Reroll any Test that is taken as part of a Journey Endeavour, or Camp Endeavour.</p></li></ul><h3>Travel Endeavours and Camp Endeavours</h3><p>Usually, a Character undertakes two Endeavours during each stage of a journey: one on route (the Travel Endeavour), and one at the end of the day (the Camp Endeavour). The GM may disallow Endeavours when the Character is busy doing other things. For example, if a character is guarding a prisoner, they may not go hunting, and if they are busy researching information about their destination, they won’t have time to help cook.</p><p>If a character does both a travel endeavour and a camp endeavour, they must pass a <strong>Hard (-20) Endurance</strong> Test or gain a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition. Fortunately for them, they should be just about to have a good night’s rest, and so, provided their sleep is peaceful and uninterrupted, they can wake up in the morning refreshed and ready for the next stage of their journey.</p><h4>Factors Impacting Endeavours</h4><p>Some of the Endeavours are affected by the weather, terrain, and other circumstances. The @Table[weather]{Weather Table} and @UUID[.M0ErxS6tPnwsFsRb#terrain-table]{Terrain Table} show some of these modifiers. The GM can add their own. For example, should a Character have to walk all day in wet clothes, that will hamper them, and if they are hungry or thirsty tasks become trickier. In places such as the heights of the Grey Mountains and depths of the Furdienst, such discomforts become extreme.</p><p>Certain Endeavours involve similar activities and so can be done simultaneously. The same Character can do a Map Endeavour and a Navigate Endeavour with a -1 SL penalty to both tests. Similarly, two of the Water, Hunt, Forage, and Scout Endeavours can be attempted by the same Character with a -1 SL penalty to each.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/camp.webp\" width=\"280\" /></div><h4>Terrain Table</h4><p>Here is a list of suggested modifiers for certain Endeavours depending on the terrain. Some of these penalties may be mitigated if the party have access to particular equipment or magic. As an example, the penalty to the Navigation Endeavour in Deep Forest is imposed as a result of being unable to easily see the sky or landmarks, but a party with a ladder or flying Wizard will not suffer from this particular problem. The penalty to the Make Camp Endeavour in Mountains is due to the Characters being exposed on the rocky cliffs. However, if they can find a convenient cave to sleep in this will mitigate the issue.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Terrain Table</em></h4><table style=\"text-align:center\"><tbody><tr><td><p><em><strong>Terrain Table</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Navigation</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Water</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Foraging</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Hunt/Fish</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Make Camp</strong></em></p></td><td><p><em><strong>Watch</strong></em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>Light Woodland</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL/–</em></p></td><td><p><em>+2 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>Hills</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>–/–</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>Deep forest</em></p></td><td><p><em>-2 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>+2 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL/–</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>Temperate Plains</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL/–</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>Wetland</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>+2 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>–/+1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>+1 SL</em></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>Mountains</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td><td><p><em>-2 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL/-2 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>-1 SL</em></p></td><td><p><em>–</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><h3>Consequences of Shortfalls</h3><p>One of the problems with wilderness travel is that there isn’t always enough time to make good headway whilst performing the other tasks necessary to sustain good health.

Depending on the terrain, this can involve mushrooms, honey, herbs, wild vegetables, fruit, insects, and shellfish. The Forage Endeavour requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong>, <strong>Lore (Herbs)</strong>, or similar Test. Every SL results in enough food for one person for one day.

To create a map that imparts a bonus to those following it subsequently, a Character must make an <strong>Average (+20) Trade (Cartography)</strong> or <strong>Challenging (+0) Art (Drawing)</strong> Test. The test must be made at every stage of the journey. A success also brings a +1 SL bonus to the next Stage’s Navigate Endeavour.</p><p>A Map Endeavour is usually done as a Travel Endeavour but can be undertaken as a Double Endeavour, meaning the mapper is spending time on the journey and in camp engaged in the task, and cannot perform any other Endeavours. This brings a +1 SL bonus to the test. A simple chart made in this way could fetch @Credit[3ss]{3 shillings} for every stage it covers. Any SL above the minimum required results in a well-drawn map that fetches double this price, and a cartographer with a reputation for accuracy may command higher fees.</p><h4>Scout Endeavour</h4><p>Scouting requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test. A success means the party are given advance warning of any adverse Travel Events they are due to encounter. If they are able to warn their fellow travellers of a threat that could be avoided by taking another route, the Event can be avoided by adding two further stages to the journey.</p><h4>Track Endeavour</h4><p>An alternative to navigating across the wilderness is to follow another’s course. This can be done with a Track Endeavour. All that is required to follow an oblivious quarry (or one that is not covering its tracks) is an <strong>Average (+20) Tracking</strong> Test. If the quarry is aware of the pursuers they can be allowed an Opposed Test using @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.Xk5tp3aasPNtk4zt]{Stealth (Rural)} to throw their pursuers off the scent. If the test fails, then the party can be given another chance to test once they realise they have lost track of their quarry. This involves backtracking to their last reliable location.</p><h4>Water Endeavour</h4><p>In some environments water is scarce and its collection is vital. In this case, it requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Outdoor Survival</strong> Test. A success provides enough water to replenish the entire expedition. Travellers should beware of contaminated water. This might occur on a Critical Failure. A Character can be given a <strong>Challenging (+0) Perception</strong> Test to spot this. Consuming contaminated water requires a test for @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.herUmN51D9TiL2Vn]{The Bloody Flux}.</p><p></p>"

To reflect the difficult conditions of a makeshift camp this should be changed to Challenging. If the Make Camp Endeavour results in a Critical Success, however, this goes back to Average. A succesful Make Camp Endeavour also protects the Characters from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#exposure]{Exposure to Heat or Cold} if they are making camp in sweltering or chilly conditions.</p><p>On a failure the camp is flawed in some way and the sleep is not restful. Perhaps the ground is uncomfortable, the shelter leaks or collapses, or the location has a strangely ominous air. On a Fumble the GM can make up some crucial flaw in the camp which could result in more serious problems. Perhaps some equipment is lost or damaged. Maybe the camp was set up in a gully and in the middle of the night it is flooded. Even worse, they may have inadvertently made camp next to a popular hunting spot for large predators. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-zoo.actors.Actor.zhHUsmQUEEV6Gkyp]{Griffons}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.actors.Actor.RiXpMLex8SZf6gaQ]{Hippogryphs}, and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.actors.Actor.Yee9gwxJUceGbnO2]{Pegasi} are occasionally encountered by travellers in the Hagercrybs and the Grey Mountains.</p><h4>Recuperate Endeavour</h4><p>Most journeys will be hard going and physically draining after sustained periods. Sometimes it can be prudent to simply not travel for a day, taking advantage of an established camp and pleasant conditions. This can bolster morale and be an opportunity to get rid of any @Condition[Fatigued] Conditions.</p><p>This Endeavour is spoiled if any @Condition[Fatigued] Conditions are earned during the day, or if the party ends up exerting themselves significantly. Some party members may undertake other Camp Endeavours while others spend their time recuperating.</p><h4>Trap Endeavour</h4><p>This involves setting traps around the camp area, usually for small mammals, but bird and fish traps are common enough. Trapping is too sedentary to be effective on the move of course, so Trap Endeavours must be performed during the camp.</p><p>This requires a <strong>Challenging (+0) Set Trap</strong> Test. With a bit of fortune, the trapper will find quarry in their traps come the morning, hopefully in time for breakfast. Each SL results enough food for a single person for a day. A Critical Success could result in double that. A Fumble may result in the bait, or cries of a captured animal, attracting a large predator.</p><p>Note that any food acquired through trapping will have to be cooked with a Cook Endeavour in order to avoid the risk of contracting the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.txeLd7R13qxSvmsr]{Galloping Trots}.</p><h4>Watch Endeavour</h4><p>This involves staying up all or part of the night and keeping watch on behalf of your sleeping comrades. This can be a vital role in enemy territory and woe betide anyone who falls asleep on duty.</p><p>This can be done as an extra Endeavour in addition to the Travel and the Camp ones, but if it is then the watcher will incur an extra @Condition[Fatigued] Condition during the watch. Watching for three hours or less allows the Character enough rest to remove their fatigue. If they have to watch for longer than that they will not get enough sleep to shake any fatigue they may have gained. If they do go on watch whilst suffering a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition, they will need to make an <strong>Average (+20) Willpower Test</strong> or fall asleep on duty.</p>"

          "text": "<blockquote><p> ‘I spent all morning trying to convince the ornery beast to shift. Then this muleskinner merely showed it her whip, and it moved on like it wanted to.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Franz Schmidt, Reikland Merchant</em></p><p>‘Her battle of wills with the beast lasted about twenty minutes. Caused a traffic jam on the Three Toll Bridge and I was late for work. What a dumb, stubborn, stinking creature! The mule wasn’t much better…’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Gobelo Schneider, Altdorf Commuter</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Using your way with animals and knowledge of the terrain, you are responsible for getting your cargo safely delivered while keeping your animals fit and healthy.</em></p><p>The land trade routes of the Empire could not function nearly so well, or even at all, without the presence of the muleskinners. They get their name from their ability to cajole those famously stubborn beasts of burden, but muleskinners are just as likely to work with horses, donkeys, oxen, and more exotic animals. </p><p>Despite their seemingly humble role they are vital to the success of any trade caravan. They are respected on route as much for their rapport with the animals, as their local knowledge, and an implacable nature which often resembles that of their bestial charges. A wise merchant always considers the opinion of their muleskinners and does not push them too hard.</p><p>As well as keeping the caravan moving and their animals healthy, a muleskinner contributes to the smooth running of the vehicles and the defence of the train.</p><p>Muleskinners work all over the Old World, but are particularly associated with Averland, and its vast herds of cattle and horses.</p><h4>Merchant Caravans</h4><p>Muleskinners are employed by merchants to oversee the welfare of the animals that transport their wares. Merchants and pedlars are common enough upon the Empire’s roads but the huge snaking trains that wend their way across the Empire from one great town to another are a sight to behold. These are often dozens, and sometimes a hundred wagons long.</p><p>While an amateur, a muleskinner might start off as a mere driver, having little to do but ensure the pack animals do the work. They are soon given more responsibility and involvement in the running of the wagon train.</p><p>Much of the work in a caravan is done at the beginning and end of the day — looking after the animals, feeding and watering them, cleaning their tack, and preparing them for the day’s journey. As they progress, muleskinners become more involved in working out the tricky logistics of such large caravans.</p><p>Muleskinners are also involved in the everyday running of the convoy, taking their turn to forage or scout, and keeping an eye out for raids from bandits, Goblins or Beastmen. If trouble does occur, they defend the caravan like they are defending their own home and family.</p><h4>Armies on the March</h4><p>Armies on campaign require massive supply operations and they often employ experienced civilian muleskinners to help run their baggage trains. These muleskinners can be unlucky enough to find themselves in the thick of the fighting from time to time, as the baggage train can be a valuable strategic goal.</p><h4>The Entrepenuerial Muleskinner</h4><p>Instead of merely driving in the pay of merchants, muleskinners might save enough to buy their own animals and cart, and offer their services that way, taking on more responsibility for their cargo but also making more money on the deal. A clever and ambitious muleskinner might end up with their own stable of animals and a fleet of wagons, controlling their own huge caravans.</p><p>Being a muleskinner affords opportunities to travel the length and breadth of the Empire, but also far beyond her borders. Caravans make their way to the corners of Estalia and Tilea, and also travel east across the World’s Edge Mountains and, since the expeditions of the Tilean explorers Ricco and Robbio in 1699 IC, through the Dark Lands towards Ind and Grand Cathay. Many an old muleskinner has fantastical tales to tell of these lands, but just as many never make it back. Heavily guarded caravans occasionally make their way south through the Badlands towards Araby, but most merchants think it wiser to go there by sea.</p><p>The life of a muleskinner within the Empire is one of travel, and the occasional adventure, but it is easy to see how a young, adventurous muleskinner might find more excitement. A reliable muleskinner can find employment with any venture that requires a wagon and team. Many of these can be dangerous or illegal — how is a tomb raider to get their plunder back to civilisation? How might a smuggler carry a large amount of their illicit goods? How would an explorer carry all the equipment for their expedition? How is a mercenary band to carry their supplies? They all require the services of a muleskinner who knows to keep their mouth shut and whip handy.</p><h4>Exotic Beasts of Burden</h4><p>Beasts of burden come in many forms, but Human muleskinners tend to work with the more mundane creatures, Kislevites use dogs and bears to pull their wares through the snowy wastes. Dwarfs use mountain goats, but they prize the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-zoo.actors.Actor.LLeH7f0EOgyA2j72]{Rhinox} most of all. Unfortunately for them, even the Dwarfs’ prodigious willpower pales in a contest of wills with a Rhinox.</p><p>Halflings tend to use any animal that is handy to pull their carts: goats, pigs, dogs, and badgers are common enough. One Halfling has even claimed to use rabbits, but he was drunk. Halflings pride themselves on their carrot and stick approach: they eat the carrot while goading the animals with a stick.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\" style=\"overflow:hidden\"><img

His worshippers aren’t members of structured cults like the other Old World gods. They have a personal relationship with the Trickster and commune with him on their own terms. Ranald’s priests may have followers, and preach parables, but there is little formal hierarchy or dogma to his worship.</p><p>Ranald doesn’t much care for public displays of veneration, provided his followers respect his strictures. As a god who favours deceit and thievery, Ranald’s worship is not trusted in many places. Cultists keep their worship discreet, especially where the authorities are concerned.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/images/apotheosis.webp\" /></div><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Depictions of Ranald</em></h4><p><em>Ranald is a mercurial deity, so his appearance changes readily. Typically a young, dashing man with a knowing smirk, sometimes a woman of high fashion and arch manners, or an older person looking refined but mischievous.</em></p><p><em>The Night Prowler often hides their face in a shadowy hood, while the Deceiver may have a featureless mask to conceal their appearance. Sometimes an artist uses a subtle depiction of Ranald in a work of art. In many such cases, they portray him as a black cat or a magpie gazing out of the canvas with a furtive look.</em></p><p><em>The best known depiction of Ranald is a work by the Tilean artist Grottio commissioned by Baron Gustav von Bruner of Ubersreik in 2226 IC. The noble was a keen gambler and believed honouring Ranald would help him win success at the gaming tables of Altdorf, Nuln, and Marienburg. Tintoverdi’s model for Shallya was his muse Giulia, so it is no surprise the goddess dominates the scene. She draws the eye rather more than Ranald himself — whose face is hidden in respect for his followers’ preference for anonymity.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Aspects of Ranald</h3><p>The Trickster God has several aspects, best illustrated by the tales people tell of his adventures. Ranald always uses luck, sharp wits, and humour to achieve his ends — just as his followers aspire to do the same.</p><p></p><p><strong>Stealthy Creeper and Light-Fingered Knave<br /></strong>In the aspect of the Night Prowler, Ranald is a patron of thieves, smugglers, cutpurses, and other rogues. The Night Prowler is the hero of stories such as:</p><ul><li><p>How Ranald stole the Emperor’s horse as he sat upon it, then sold it back to him</p></li><li><p>How Ranald sewed Josef Bugman into his bedclothes and took the best ales from his cellar</p></li><li><p>How Ranald stole the finest Dragonship from the harbour of Lothern</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Supreme Chancer and Pusher of Luck</strong> <br />Ranald as the Gamester is always trying his luck to get one over on a rival or enemy. Followers who favour this aspect are gamblers and those who see a game in everything they do — trying their luck to best their opponents and live the good life. Stories that feature the Gamester include:</p><ul><li><p>How Ranald won a bet by proving he could walk on the clouds</p></li><li><p>How Ranald played dice with Ulric and won his best wolfskin cloak</p></li><li><p>How Ranald invented the game of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.journals.JournalEntry.OnhGK8IE9SCGAlRT.JournalEntryPage.vSnJs2wpgPfHzSaZ]{Scarlet Empress} to impress the most beautiful woman in Averland</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Protector of the Powerless, Humbler of the Powerful</strong> <br />Ranald the Protector disdains tyranny and seeks to redress unfairness. Followers of the Protector are passionate about defending the poor and downtrodden against exploitation and cruelty from the higher orders. They may be agitators or leaders of an oppressed community needing a champion. Examples of Protector tales include:</p><ul><li><p>How Ranald fed one thousand orphans with bread from the greedy burgomeister’s kitchen</p></li><li><p>How Ranald helped the Dwarfs to fulfil a grudge against a cruel landlord</p></li><li><p>How Ranald replaced the Graf ’s crown with something nasty from the privy</p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Elemental Force of Mischief, Humour, and Deception</strong> <br />Ranald the Deceiver is a consummate liar, a weaver of trickery and illusion. Those who follow the Deceiver come from all walks of life, united by a passion for duplicity. Charlatans, spies, Grey magisters, and entertainers are often devotees. Tales of the Deceiver include:</p><ul><li><p>How Ranald convinced Talabheim’s High Magistrate to burn his own britches</p></li><li><p>How Ranald danced with three different grail damsels in one night</p></li><li><p>How Ranald made the Norscans fight one another over a single nail and sunk their whole fleet</p></li></ul><p>There is little to no rivalry between followers who favour one aspect of Ranald over the others. They are widely recognised as facets of the same god and no aspect is considered superior. Ranaldans embody the god’s aspects by emulating his deeds so that they compliment rather than oppose each other. They might use deception to protect the downtrodden or gamble skillfully to provide cover for an ingenious theft.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-OSD4GMhgj2SRrM2M\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Caught in the Crossfire</h3><p>Once every few years, the priests of Ranald throughout Wissenland compete to outwit one another — stealing, fooling, and gambling to prove themselves the most deserving of the god’s favour. This competition is all the more challenging because the priests do not know the others’ identities. The Characters are unwittingly pulled into an elaborate scam by a trickster-priest from Meissen trying to get one over a thief-priest in Wissenburg.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">The Wheel of Justice</h3><p></p><p>Judge Nussmeg is a notoriously harsh magistrate who cares little for justice. He is known for exaggerating the charges against the accused and then sentencing them to arbitrary, randomly-selected punishments. Followers of the Protector believe they can humiliate and bring down Nussmeg just through the power of spreading tales of Ranald throughout the town. However, Viktor Vogt, a gambler-priest, wonders whether the ‘Wheel of Justice’ Nussmeg uses to select punishments suggests he is a secret follower of Ranald the Gamester.</p></section><p></p>"

          "name": "Olde Weirde’s Incunabulum",
          "text": "<p>Upon a Bezahltag evening, it is my habit to retire to the saloon bar of The Crown and Two Chairmen with Professor Gronighof and Professor Pfaff and converse over a few pints of Braakbroew ale. On such occasions it is our custom to discuss an esoteric matter decided upon at the end of the previous week’s session. Last week Gronighof put it to us that a fascinating topic would be origin stories told of the trickster Ranald, and which roguish tendency of his followers endorsed which legend. I rather suspect Gronighof, who is alleged to have spent his younger days breaking into the catacombs of Nehekharan pyramids, has had cause to cross his fingers and seek the trickster’s benedictions more than once. Pfaff, predictably, denounced Ranald and his works like the good pious Sigmarite he so often insists to be, but he deigned to attend, nevertheless.</p><p>As it was, once we had settled into our seats and consumed a pint of the Wasteland’s finest, it was Pfaff who first broached the issue, though it seems to me he did so in order to frame the conversation within the context of damning followers of Ranald as slothful, blasphemous, and unlettered.</p><p>‘Of course, there is no official account of the origins of the Night Prowler,’ he claimed. ‘His followers are either unable to write, or fearful of public scrutiny. I have heard many tales of the Night Prowler’s origins, and frankly, the one to which I attach most credence has it that he is an unintended by-blow of the machinations of the Dark Powers. A legend of the savage Bjornling Norse has it that those most heinous of daemonic powers once waged war upon each other, and the Bloody God of Slaughter turned his axe on the Inconstant God of Sorcery and smote two of the fingers from his left hand. These fell from the hellish realm and landed in Marienburg, of all places, one finger on top of the other in the shape of a cross. Just as the fingers touched the muddy ground, they turned into the form of a man, who sprang up as none other than the Night Prowler. He set out to corrupt people with the promise of unearned luck, the prospect of ill-gotten gains, and the unearned satisfaction of disrespecting authority.’</p><p>Gronighof and I caught each other’s eye. Pfaff’s students complain that his lectures turn into sermons, and in my experience, a little ale only exacerbates the issue.</p><p>‘No doubt this account is shared by genteel folk such as yourself,’ Gronighof said, ‘but of course, the tale most commonly told of how the Trickster came to be numbered amongst the gods that of how he fooled Shallya.’</p><p>‘A calumny beloved of cozeners and bandits!’ Pfaff was clearly unwilling to entertain this tale, but Gronighof persisted.</p><p>‘According to the legend, Ranald was once a mortal bandit roaming the wilds around Bordeleaux. Far from your typical Bretonnian brigand, he was cunning, dashing, and never brutal, using his wits to rob the rich and give to the poor. Gentle Shallya noticed this outlaw’s compassion towards the needy, and loved him for it. One day, Ranald stole tapestries from a greedy duke’s castle, who had barred his gates while the peasants outside died from a plague sent by the Lord of Flies. The outlaw succumbed to the pox himself and lay dying. Shallya could not bear to see her beloved taken from the world, so she let him sip from her holy chalice. The outlaw sprang from his deathbed, now a god himself. He looked at Shallya and laughed. His illness had been guile invented to trick her into granting him immortality. Ranald kissed her hand, bowed, and skipped away to tease the gods for eternity.’</p><p>‘A dreadful tale, providing a terrible example to the youth,’ said Pfaff, but now it was my turn to tell a tale. I had found in the university library a collection of Tilean and Estallian folktales (A Compendium of the Rustic Notions and Hedge Theology of the Southern Realms of the Old World, The Empress Agnetha University of Nuln Press 2474 IC). It included a story of how Ranald had been a young ne’er-do-well from the city of Luccini. He boasted he could make the god Morr smile — and challenged the sullen god of death that, were he to be successful, Morr would not take him through his gate when he died but elevate him to godhood. Morr accepted this wager because, as the text states, ‘the god of death always needs cheering up’. He summoned Ranald to his gloomy garden of black roses, and in front of an audience of a thousand departed souls, the young mortal told Morr a joke so funny that one side of the death god’s mouth lifted just a fraction. Sadly, the joke itself has been lost, but Ranald was elevated to godhood, just as Morr promised.</p><p>Pfaff was even less impressed with my recollection of this fable than he was with Gronighof’s. ‘There will come a day,’ he intoned, as grim as Morr himself, ‘when you will have to beg entrance to that god’s realm of shades and may have to account for treating such impieties with such levity.’</p><p>But Gronighof was energised by my story. ‘I have another!’ He said. ‘Of how Rhya hid the Trickster!’</p><p>‘And so the Old Gods are not safe from your scurrilous gossiping either!’</p><p>‘This I have from a student who heard it from a friend who visited Khypris in the Border Princedoms. Taal, the god of the wilds and the beasts, was away creating a particularly intricate mountain range, and Rhya was alone in their bower at the heart of the world. The Grey Wind known as Ulgu blew through the land and when Rhya went to river to fetch herself drinking water she discovered a babe, crying by the riverbank. She passed into the mortal world and hid the infant god in Al-Haikk. Ranald grew up around mortals, not knowing the identity of his mother until the day he snuck into the realms of the gods to take up his rightful place in the pantheon.’</p><p>‘The worst slander yet!’ Pfaff rose from his chair. ‘I’ll take my leave now and you two may continue to utter such lunacies to one another without fear of my continued vexation. I shall see you next week, and, it being my turn to choose a topic for discussion, we will meditate on the lives and times of the historical Grand Theogonists and their importance to the cohesion and moral fabric of our great Empire.’</p><p>I tried to mollify the professor, for he can be amusing and enlightening company despite his umbrages. I pointed out that in 2305 IC, Ranald’s cult briefly experienced respectability when Magnus the Pious instituted the Grand Conclave, where priests of the major religions met every five years to discuss their disputes and threats to the Empire. Whilst there was shock and disapproval when Magnus invited a priest of Ranald to attend, invite them he did.</p><p>But Pfaff wasn’t having it. ‘It goes to show that even the greatest men may blunder,’ he said as he pulled on his cloak.</p><p>Gronighof became rather more enthused about the legends of Ranald in Pfaff’s absence and soon my misgivings about having alienated our colleague were forgotten.</p><p>‘The Trickster is worshipped through deeds that emulate the god’s own legends rather than in contemplation or prayer.’ He claimed. ‘Wherever Ranaldans gather, or when a priest meets other followers, they tell stories of Ranald’s exploits — old tales they know well, new tales they have heard, and perhaps a few they’ve made up themselves. The very act of sharing stories of Ranald’s adventures is considered a form of worship by these people — it imparts spiritual lessons, bringing the worshipper closer to their god and spreading his creed.’</p><p>He downed his tankard of Braakbreow, and the dregs left at the bottom of Pfaff’s abandoned tankard, and a chaser of firey Eilhart Obstler before continuing.</p><p>‘The most important stories of Ranald are always those legends that made the trickster famous. Rather like great jokes, the most popular tales have two qualities — they reveal the core of Ranald’s essence, and they compel the listener to repeat them to others. In this manner, legends of Ranald spread from inn to barracks to marketplace to a noble’s table. Every listener feels entertained, while the essence of the tales imparts a fraction of Ranald’s mischief and trickery into their minds.’</p><p>I was confused myself as to the age of these tales. Whatever Ranald’s origins, people have worshipped him throughout the Old World for at least two thousand years. The Verenan monastery of Eyrie has ledgers in its library, which date from 752 IC. Within their pages is an entry where a forgotten Nulner clerk complains of the ‘petty thievery of the Magpie cultists.’ Similarly, in Talabheim, lawmakers executed a priest spreading subversive tales of the ‘Prince of Cats’ in 910 IC.</p><p>Gronighof agreed. ‘The cult has been present since those times, if not even earlier, usually out of sight. Invoking Ranald’s name for luck is a long-held tradition, even amongst those who disapprove of the god. I swear I have even seen Professor Pfaff cross his fingers before a meeting with the Chancellor about the relevency of his syllabus and whether any of his lectures might clash with those of a less tedious speaker. Open worship of Ranald has always been rare, which is why his followers have left such little trace in the historical record.’</p><p>I am sure the conversation would have continued, but we were interrupted by two of the doormen who do such a good job of ensuring students and riff-raff are prevented from drinking in The Mattheus II, and rather roughly escorted from the premises.</p><p>Gronighof tried to remonstrate with them, and I heard them mutter about our having tried to settle our last bill with a gold coin which turns out to have been made of lead. I’m afraid fisticuffs ensued between Gronighof and the men, who were more than a match for the inebriated scholar.</p><p>So, as it was, I could make little sense of the matter of the forged coin and never really got to the bottom of it. I was left to heave the dead weight of a stupefied and bleeding Professor Marius von Gronighof back to his dormitory. He is a liability at times — though I was able to wonder at his marvellous private collection of Nehekharan artefacts.</p>"

The Crooked Fingers are thieves, fences, blackmailers, con artists, and other criminals who implore Ranald for good fortune in their practices. The Crooked Fingers keep their membership discreet to avoid persecution by the authorities. See @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-eis.journals.JournalEntry.ro7SIltM899Ogrk8.JournalEntryPage.4ReRtWDuzv5oEq3L]{The Crossed Pikes} of Enemy in Shadows for an example of a group of Crooked Fingers in Bögenhafen.</p><h4>The Crosses</h4><p>A sect of gambler-priests who run gaming dens. Most cities and larger towns host gambling houses run by the Crosses. In accordance with their faith, they donate a cut of their earnings to the cult and a proportion to the poor. Priests from this sect are often informally called ‘Crosses.’ They may say ‘She’s a Cross, be careful at her table,’ or ‘Go and take it up with the Cross if you’re not happy with the game.’ See @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-starter-set.journals.JournalEntry.TSyoR9nSk7cehypG.JournalEntryPage.XrD7HLaASDeDsVmR]{The Crooked Hammer} for an example of a Cross operation in Ubersreik.</p><h4>The Brotherhood</h4><p>Also known as the Givers of Coin. The Brotherhood are a secretive cabal of merchants who revere Ranald the Protector and keep it secret. They work to extract money from greedy merchants and redirect it to those who need protection from the powerful.

It is a feast day, and throughout the Old World, people of all classes and ranks enjoy revels in Ranald’s name. The Day of Folly is a carnival of the people, with many local traditions — for example, the festivities in Nuln are different to ‘Jape Day’ in Altdorf and so on.</p><p>Everyone hopes that by honouring Ranald on his favoured day, they shall gain a little luck for the next year — and they generally enjoy themselves, even if they distrust the god. The rich and powerful have a chance to show a little humility and hopefully reduce the possibility of unrest. The Cults of Sigmar, Ulric, and Taal tolerate the mockery of secular authority to remind local lords they are fallible. Similarly, the nobility appreciates the parody of religious rituals as a reminder to priests they are not all-powerful.</p><p>The Day of Folly has been condemned throughout the Empire’s history. In authoritarian locations, like Talabheim, festivities are restrained and toothless. Bretonnian nobles tolerate the tomfoolery as long as it does not mock the Lady or her knights. However, it’s very much regarded as a peasants’ festival, and knights consider it beneath their dignity to attend the celebrations.

          "text": "<p>In some places, authorities have proscribed the worship of the Trickster God. In others, the cult meets with disapproval and reluctant tolerance — although most of Ranald’s followers are wise enough to keep a low profile.</p><p><strong>Criminal Organisations —</strong> Where organised crime involves guile, stealth, and dishonesty, Ranaldans are quite at home, and thief-priests frequently join criminal gangs to advise and assist them in their enterprises. However, Ranald’s opposition to violent crime puts his followers at odds with many criminal enterprises. In fact, his priests work against racketeers and thuggish criminal groups — they give honest thieves a bad name.</p><p><strong>Legal Authorities —</strong> In every town and city, the watch and law courts are implacably opposed to the practices of the Cult of Ranald, and the feeling is mutual. Ranald’s followers take pleasure in fooling the authorities and taunting them afterwards. Even where the cult is not proscribed, officials find ways to persecute priests of Ranald or round up followers on spurious charges. Little wonder then that the faithful keep their identities secret.</p><p>There are exceptions. Corrupt authorities abound, happy to turn a blind eye to Ranaldan activities for the right price. Many watchmen would rather deal with restrained thievery than violent thuggery and murder.</p><p><strong>Verena —</strong> Ranald’s cult disrespects the law and snubs its nose at legal institutions, so it should come as no surprise that Verenans denounce the cult. They consider Ranald’s followers criminal by nature, so their practices are beyond the pale. Behind the doors of Verena’s temples, there is debate amongst cultists — if they believe in justice rather than strict adherence to written law, they must support the Cult of Ranald when it does the right thing.</p><p><strong>Handrich —</strong> Outside Marienburg, Handrich is not well understood. Folk are confused about whether Handrich is genuinely distinct from Ranald, as both use their wits to obtain money from people. The emergence of Ranald the Dealer further muddies the waters. The Cult of Handrich are clear about the difference — they support ruthless business practice but not dishonesty. Ranald has no such qualms. The Defenders of Capital are the Handrich cult’s enforcers — they are especially vehement in protecting their members’ interests against the thievery of Ranaldans.</p><p><strong>Shallya —</strong> The Cult of Shallya do not approve of Ranald or his followers. They are aware of the legend that tells of Ranald tricking Shallya into granting him immortality, and even those who do not believe it find it fitting of the Trickster’s underhanded wiles. They may resent priests of Ranald for assuming that Shallyan institutions are places where they can receive healing, or find a new apprentice, without having to answer for their crimes. Shallyans commonly find their doctrine of mercy seriously tested by Ranaldans taking liberties.</p><p><strong>Sigmar —</strong> The Cult of Sigmar upholds order in the Empire, reinforces hierarchy, and disapproves of all who seek to subvert the established authorities. As such, some of the strongest condemnation of the Cult of Ranald comes from Sigmarite priests.</p><p><strong>Taal and Ulric —</strong> The Old Gods’ cults do not approve of the duplicitous urban Cult of Ranald, and Ulricans, in particular, say his underhand practices make him a coward. In Talabheim and Middenheim, priests of Taal and Ulric are vocal in pressing the authorities to keep Ranaldan activity suppressed.</p><p><strong>Halflings —</strong> The Cult of Ranald is on good terms with the Halfling community in most towns and cities. Halflings think Humans make a terrible fuss about religion and fawn over gods in a way that the diminutive folk find peculiar, but they can’t help but like Ranald. Travelling followers of Ranald like to seek the company of Halflings to find out what’s going on and exchange tales with them.</p><p><strong>The Ruinous Powers —</strong> Ranald sits on the fringe of acceptable society, but his cultists still oppose the forces of wanton destruction and corruption. Whilst Ranald’s followers are not as vigilant or as educated regarding the nature of Chaos as those of Sigmar are, they still brook no tolerance for the Ruinous Powers or their servants.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Humble Ones</em></h4><p><em>A fanatical sect of Ranaldans known as the Humble Ones work in small groups to completely destroy the life of a rich or powerful person.

Of course, many followers are reticent in revealing their names, so these rapscallions may be known only by secret identities.</p><p><strong>Titus Jemar (1667 to 1703 IC) —</strong> A Tilean philosopher from Remas, Jemar wrote extensively on theology, usually taking a contrarian view. His most notorious stance was insisting that Ranald created the other gods as a grand cosmic prank. Remas’ Cults of Solkan, Morr, Manann, and Verena fought between themselves over who would burn Jemar and finally agreed to throw him into the sea. The heresy of Jemarism persists to this day, but only the most unhinged Ranaldans take it seriously.</p><p><strong>Felix Mann (c2020 to 2051 IC) —</strong> Felix Mann was the greatest thief of his age, with a dozen aliases and as many wealthy widows and merchants fooled into trusting him. His greatest exploit occurred at the Siege of Altdorf during the First Vampire War. The Grand Theogonist offered him a pardon and riches if he would steal the famed Carstein Ring from the hand of the Vampire Count Vlad von Carstein. In 2051 IC, Mann robbed Vlad of his immortality, allowing the Grand Theogonist to defeat the vampire. He is remembered as a Hero of the Empire, and Ranaldans claim he was one of their own — the lack of concrete evidence being sure proof of his cunning.</p><p><strong>Guntar the Swift (c2250 to 2268 IC) —</strong> A famous thief who took a wager with a priest of Ranald to break into the Imperial Palace in Altdorf and steal a kiss from the Empress. Several hours later, he clambered over the palace wall with the rosy mark of a kiss on his cheek. The following day he was summarily hung, drawn, and quartered — Guntar is venerated for his display of sheer dumb bravado in the face of impossible odds.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-5xPXBnBDerEi5lji\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Redeeming Crimes</h3><p>The feats of famous Ranaldans stand as examples of the sort of deeds that might impress the god.

He turned his studies to the manipulation of chance and made several items that could help a gambler tip the odds in this favour, most notably Wyssan’s Weighted Dice. Nobody knows how many he created, but Ranaldans always look to get their hands on a set.</p><p><strong>Shadow-Prowler Hans von Kleptor (2471 IC to present) —</strong> The most prominent priest of Ranald in the Old World today, von Kleptor leads the Ranaldan cult in Marienburg from the Gilt House, the closest thing the port city has to a temple of Ranald. Also known as Kurt von Shent, a notorious charlatan, von Kleptor seeks to unite the aspects of Ranald and wishes to bring his cult out of the shadows. Few of his fellow cultists agree though, as the shadows suit them just fine.</p><p><strong>Jakob and Wilhelmina Kauter (c2475 IC to present) —</strong> Twin priests of Ranald, Wilhelmina is a trickster-priestess and Jakob a liberator-priest. It is their life’s work to break into the homes of merchants and nobles, steal precious artworks, and replace them with a near-perfect forgery. On close inspection, subtle chages can be seen — a wealthy burgomeister is now notably porcine and his hat is a saucepan, a heroic general has the tail and ears of an ass, and so on. The Kauters are also responsible for hoaxes. They claim to have created the celebrated ‘Obernarn Stone’, which tells a tale of the gods (including Ranald and obscure entities like Sotek and Margileo) fighting the Ruinous Powers.</p><p><strong>White Raven (c2475 to present) —</strong> A famous highway robber, feared by the nobility and road wardens alike for her audacious robberies on the roads between Altdorf and Middenland. White Raven wears a feathered white mask to hide her identity. She is a crack shot with a pistol and seems completely unflappable (though an unverified rumour has it that she demonstrates an extreme and merciless loathing for squirrels). Songs about White Raven are popular in taverns throughout the Reikland and Middenland.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.actors.Actor.qEmLewEnphflW6zi]{Count Jager} —</strong> A strange character roams the Empire, from the poorest slum to the highest palaces.

He’s now worried his luck has run out — a dodgy batch of ‘cure-all’ has put the watch on his tail. He bursts into the Characters’ room at their inn and asks them to cover for him.

          "text": "<blockquote><p> ‘It’s not about the necklace, although it’s very pretty. Nah — this is an act of devotion, just like the stodgy Sigmarites and their droning hymns. This necklace is proof we humble mortals can take precious things out from under the same noses that look down on us.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\">— Dramenz, Thief-Priest</p><p>‘These people are laughing in the face of the law.

With the right combination of skill and cunning, stealing from others is an act of devotion to Ranald the Night Prowler. Thief-Priests dedicate themselves to the fine art of appropriating others’ property. They pride themselves on committing crimes with flair and panache, involving intricate planning, daring escapes, and acts of legendary bravado. The more accomplished the crime, the more they venerate their god, emulating his boldest exploits and inspiring others to do the same.</p><p>Most of these roguish Ranaldans started out as regular thieves, perhaps picking pockets or lifting goods from the back of wagons when their owners were not looking. At some point, they felt a spiritual calling to Ranald, or an older priest found them and saw in them a promising initiate. Thief-Priests always know the local gangs of young criminals and keep their eyes out for potential protégés to instruct in the ways of Ranald. It’s as simple as having an initiate swear they’ll follow Ranald’s strictures, and then they’re on the path to priesthood — Ranaldans don’t go in for complex ceremonies.</p><h4>Embodying the Night Prowler</h4><p>These followers of Ranald live as the Night Prowler would if he were in mortal guise. They practise and celebrate theft as an artform, providing blessings and guidance to criminals who use stealth, ingenuity, and guile to take things from others. They strive to curtail violence in other underworld characters, reining in thuggery and showing by their actions that there are sneaky, subtle, and bloodless ways to steal for a living.</p><p>While they are criminals, Thief-Priests still answer to a higher purpose. They believe criminality and theft are necessary to redress the inherent unfairness of the world. They tend to avoid stealing from the powerless and condemn criminal violence, especially vehemently if the targets are low-status or harmless.</p><p>Some are independent loners who eschew company and spread Ranald’s teachings only to those who cross their path by chance. Others are found amongst other criminals, leading capers, granting blessings, and whispering counsel in their ears. Their ‘congregation’ comprises cutpurses, pickpockets, burglars, smugglers, and common thieves. To these everyday criminals, Thief-Priests have a certain glamorous mystique, granted through their association with Ranald.</p><h4>The Dangers of the Vocation</h4><p>Life as a Thief-Priest is inherently risky. Their deeds must be public enough to inspire other followers as acts of worship whilst being careful enough to avoid capture. The Night Prowler is the most vilified of Ranald’s aspects, despised by the powers-that-be.</p><p>Followers of the Night Prowler need to stay sharp to stay ahead of the law. They keep their true identity secret, as their calling is inherently criminal, and they cannot trust anyone — including their associates.</p><p>While other thieves may have greater skill, the Thief-Priest uses blessings and miracles to augment their abilities, thereby pulling off legendary capers that bring praise in Ranald’s name.</p><h4>Lowly Stations and Lofty Heights</h4><p>Thief-Priests come from all walks of society, from the lowest rookery to the upper echelons. There are even rumours that an incognito Thief-Priest serves Karl Franz at the highest level in the Imperial Palace. Their secret identity depends on their station in life — a poor priest may masquerade as a loiterer or marketplace storyteller. At the same time, one from the higher classes could pretend to be a respectable merchant or a staunch pillar of the aristocracy.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Ranald’s Gamble</em></h4><p><em>Any kind of priest of Ranald can buy Miracles at the usual increasing XP cost. Or they can trust in luck and hope that Ranald is with them today…</em></p><p><em>Take a <strong>Difficult (-10) Pray</strong> Test to ask for the Trickster God’s favour. If you fail, you incur 1 Sin Point. When you buy your next Miracle, you must pay the normal XP cost, +10 per -SL. For example, if you fail the Test by 3 SL and you are buying your second Miracle, it will cost 100 XP (normal cost) plus 30 XP, costing 130 XP in total. If you pass the Pray Test, Ranald approves of you trying your luck — you can buy your next Miracle for half the usual XP cost. For example, your second Miracle could be bought for 50 XP.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Ranald in Middenheim</em></h4><p><em>The Cult of Ranald is not especially popular in Middenheim, where the violent Low Kings control crime in the city — and do not appreciate priests telling them how to behave. The city authorities take a typically Ulrican approach to the cult, seeing it as cowardly and subversive. This is not helped by rumours of a priest of Ranald who stole the Drakwald Runefang from the Middenpalaz in 1550 IC — and gave it to the breakaway province of Middenland.</em></p></blockquote><div

They revel in wagers and games of luck and skill, seeing every turning point in life as a moment where chance could take them in a different direction. A Gambler-Priest is more than just a player of games, they have devoted themself to living by the luck granted to them by Ranald. </p><p>Some Gambler-Priests travel between various inns and gambling dens, making their living through wagers while imparting the lessons of Ranald. Others run gaming venues themselves, overseeing the house as other priests oversee a congregation. Every dice roll or card flip is a small act of devotion to Ranald. The life of a Gambler-Priest is one of highs and lows — the times when chance is going their way and life is good sit alongside times when Ranald tests them with a run of bad luck. This is all part of the spiritual journey they must take. They know they must bear the ups and downs with good grace.</p><p>Most of these Ranaldans are chosen as initiates at a gaming table. An older priest might see someone with a passion for gambling, admiring their handling of the dice or their intense focus on the cards. The priest asks a few oblique questions about luck and if they give intriguing or well-considered answers, they might make an offer — would they like to understand the true mysteries of chance and learn the ways of Ranald the Gamester?</p><p>It’s common for such folk to live an itinerant life, rarely staying in one place long enough for the locals to take umbrage with their success. Travelling from town to town is a devotional journey, following in the footsteps of their god as he also wandered the land looking for new marks. They let whim and chance take them from place to place, rather than planning in advance. In time, they may settle down in one place, laying down roots along with the cards. Gambler-Priests who choose settled life usually become part of the Crosses sect and establish a gaming den, a de facto temple to Ranald the Gamester. They minister to the gaming tables, scrutinise the punters for (the wrong kind of ) cheating, and ensure the shrine of Ranald in the corner receives its share of the winnings.</p><p>These Ranaldans work to master as many games as possible, whether they are card games, dice games, or any other form of play which involves risk and skill. Players may want to choose some favourite games @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-rnhd.journals.JournalEntry.OnhGK8IE9SCGAlRT]{from the list} in <strong>Rough Nights &amp; Hard Days</strong>. Any wager is considered to be a sacred act. Gambler-Priests study the form of pit fighters and pay close attention to racing or fighting animals. A Gambler-Priest can talk at length about the past record of a racing pigeon or the recent form of a jousting knight. They’ll also put wagers on serious issues, like the outcome of a battle or fate of an expedition. There are solemn rules and rituals surrounding a wager between Ranald’s followers, followed to the letter to ensure acceptance of the outcome by all parties.</p><p>The difference between a Gambler-Priest and a professional gambler is motivation. Priests have a religious obsession with luck and a tendency to gamify even the smallest aspects of life. They also minister to others, guiding them to embrace luck and encouraging them to pray to Ranald for good fortune.</p><p>Miracles and blessings are proof their preoccupation with chance meets Ranald’s approval. All Gambler-Priests crave and venerate the luck Ranald grants them and depend on it to live, yet they still attempt to manipulate chance with skill, knowledge, and miracles. They see no contradiction in this, as Ranald favours the guile of those who tip the odds in their favour.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/card-beatrice.webp\" width=\"250\" /></div><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Reiklander Tarock</em></h4><p><em>The most widely used deck of cards in the Empire is the Reikland Tarock, consisting of 82 cards.

          "text": "<blockquote><p> ‘This reality is simply a huge joke by Ranald. We can strip back the lies and try to live the “truth”, but then we’ll see it’s just another trick. Best to laugh along and add another layer of nonsense to life.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Janna von Beadel, Trickster-Priestess</em></p><p>‘I swear they were pigs when I bought them. I paid five gold to a little old lady… thought I was taking advantage of her. Then I come back and… well… I’ve got a lot of sacks of sand if you want one? She drew pigs’ faces on them.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Reinald Sitwald, Farmer at Bogenhafen’s Schaffenfest</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You embody Ranald at his most elemental, the divine trickster, blessing the world with his lies, illusions, and pranks.</em></p><p>Ranald’s Trickster-Priests dance through life spinning a web of falsehoods, hiding the truth behind layers of deceit, and playing elaborate tricks on the unwary. This is not merely to bamboozle or con others — it should entertain, bring a smile to those around them, and show them that nothing should be taken at face value. </p><p>Ranald the Deceiver favours those who embrace deception and view such a practice as a calling. Trickster-Priests are rare individuals. Their existence is lonely, even when surrounded by friends and family. Secrets, lies, and deception come so naturally that they may even lose sight of the truth themselves.</p><h4>A Trickster-Priest’s Calling</h4><p>Each of these Ranaldans recognise the moment when they saw their calling. It could be a joke or lie which suddenly opened their eyes to the essentially ludicrous nature of life. Or it could be a low point, where they saw the ultimate futility of existence and decided they had no choice but to mock everything in order to keep pretending life was worthwhile. Some have a moment of clarity, where they see that they are merely fictional constructs in a massive game and everything is simply an illusion conjured by an indifferent master. In those moments of revelation, Ranald sees them and sends a priest to knock at their door and take on a new initiate.</p><p>The ranks of Trickster-Priests are more diverse than any other priesthood. There are con artists, charlatans, forgers, and fences amongst their numbers. Entertainers such as actors, showmen, storytellers, and minstrels are attracted to the Deceiver. Those who live for secrets favour this aspect of Ranald.</p><p>Many of these Ranaldans have been drawn from the ranks of spies, Grey Magisters, and viziers. Certain types of witches can take up the mantle of priesthood, especially those sometimes called illusionists, wielders of magic intended to confuse and mislead.</p><h4>A Life of Trickery</h4><p>A Trickster-Priest’s existence is a picaresque journey. They rarely stay in one place for long, driven as they are to look for exciting encounters and situations along with new folk to dupe. Trickster-Priests live by their wiles — they take advantage of people by conning food, money, lodgings, and protection from the unwitting, sometimes sharing the proceeds of their trickery with others.</p><p>Many of these Tricksters travel with companions, such as an acting troupe, carnival, or group of itinerant adventurers. Friendships are always under strain — a Trickster-Priest can be loyal and considerate, but they should never be entirely trusted.</p><p>Trickster-Priests often challenge themselves to see how many people they can fool or how long they can maintain an outrageous lie before people suspect trickery. Stories of momentous lies and elaborate pranks become legends amongst followers of Ranald the Deceiver.</p><p>Other than their priestly calling, these folks rarely take anything too seriously. They do not preach or proclaim to people they meet. Instead, they teach the ways of Ranald the Deceiver through action. They prefer to fool another follower and show them something false or deceitful before lifting the curtain to reveal they should never trust what is in front of them.</p><p>This can be entertaining or charming, but it can also prove frustrating — it’s difficult to get a straight answer from a Trickster-Priest and they are particularly fond of answering a question with a riddle.</p><p>Amongst Ranald’s priests the Tricksters, are probably the most mystical. They speculate widely on the nature of reality and philosophise on the nature of artifice and perception. Few are learned scholars; their esoteric thinking is undisciplined and free of obscure academic pontification. Some Trickster-Priests tend towards utopian visions of the world — a permanent state of carnival where nothing is real and everyone can live happily in their delusions.</p><p>There are other Trickster-Priests with darker motives behind their trickery and deceit — there’s no doubt some enjoy gaining a degree of power over others that comes through deceiving them.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Grey Wizards and Ranald</em></h4><p><em>The tenets of Ranald correspond well with the beliefs and practices of the shadowmancers, wielders of the wind Ulgu. The Grey College is a loose organisation of largely autonomous wizards and many pay respect to Ranald the Deceiver. Within the tumbledown walls of the college buildings in Altdorf is a shrine to Ranald, frequented by a family of slender grey cats and passing shadowmancers.</em></p><p><em>A minority of grey wizards believe Ranald walked the world as an Incarnate of Ulgu, rather than a god. They are willing to show deference to such a being as a manifestation of their chosen Wind of Magic, but this is not the same as worshipping a deity. Few of their colleagues agree with this view.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/actors/trickster-priest.webp\"

          "text": "<blockquote><p> ‘Look at that pompous ass Karl-Werner Schattental! Typical noble - views the common man as little more than cattle. We’re good enough to die for the castle, but not good enough to shelter inside it when winter comes.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Katrin Spiegel, Liberator-Priestess</em></p><p>‘Our Lord Sigmar brought together many peoples to make his Empire. The Ulricans, the followers of Taal and Rhya, those who venerate Shallya and Verena. There’s even a place for Ranald’s faithful in Sigmar’s lands. Not the rabble rousers though — those priests of Ranald who attempt to topple his authority are scobberlotching scumbags.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Father Johan Stroman, Priest of Sigmar</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You champion the powerless in the name of Ranald the Protector.</em></p><p>Liberator-Priests are inspired to fight against authority when it is used to crush and oppress those who can’t fight for themselves. While they have earnest aims, Ranald the Protector does not expect his priests to abandon his favoured tools of ridicule, thievery, deception, and trickery, nor does he want his priests to elevate themselves to positions of authority over others. Of all Ranald’s priests, the Liberator-Priests are the most integrated into society, whether in a city’s slums or amongst an outlaw band in the countryside. </p><p>The Old World is unfair. Its people grow up surrounded by the fundamental injustice of life, with constant reminders that feckless, cowardly nobles and merchants enjoy every privilege without lifting a finger to help the downtrodden. Amongst these malcontents are those destined to become Liberator-Priests. They see in Ranald a god who stands up for people like themselves and treats authority as what it truly is: a sham. Through faith and instinct, Liberator-Priests learn to protect their friends and family from the worst the powerful can throw at them.</p><p>Other Liberator-Priests come from the more respectable classes. They cannot tolerate the oppression around them and feel compelled to devote their lives to upending the social order. While meek Shallyans merely deal with the consequences of injustice, Ranald’s followers strike at its very cause. These priests must prove themselves to overcome prejudice against their class from the poor they seek to help. Some never quite manage to shake off the faintly patronising attitude they bring to their calling.</p><p>As followers of Ranald the Protector, they see their primary goal as being to protect those who cannot protect themselves from harm or exploitation. This is not always nobles or merchants — Liberator-Priests have a special hatred of violent criminals who prey on the powerless. More than one racketeer has been chased from the streets by a Liberator-Priest and their followers.</p><p>Despite what people assume, these Ranaldans disdain political ideologies — they reject utopian thinking and mock anyone who thinks the world would be better if they were in charge. They are usually anarchists of some sort, preaching that Ranald wants them to be free of the shackles of authority, that no man should be their master or tell them what to do.</p><p>Liberator-Priests take on initiates from their community. Priests know everyone in their area, so they’ll usually select an initiate from the local urchins who shows promise. Some parents put their children forward, especially if they’re particularly annoying or unruly. New initiates face a confusing time as they learn from a Liberator-Priest— their mentor expects them to learn from them and serve as a representative of the cult, yet nevertheless teaches them a healthy disrespect for authority.</p><h4>Liberator-Priests in Town and Country</h4><p>Urban Liberator-Priests usually stay in one place, often the community where they grew up. They tend to a local shrine, which may move around to stay ahead of the authorities. They know the local agitators, and while they don’t trust ideologues, they may help or hinder them in their cause, if it aligns with their own. They’ll also usually have extensive contacts in the local underworld.</p><p>Rural Liberator-Priests are usually itinerant, sometimes accompanying groups of outlaws, especially those who fight against oppressive lords, such as Bretonnia’s herrimaults. Sometimes they will also travel alone between villages, stirring up dissent against cruel overlords, persuading people not to pay tax, and defending peasants against the lord’s men.</p><p>Some itinerant priests deliberately travel to places where people need protection from the powerful. Bringing down oppressors becomes a holy mission they believe was given to them by Ranald himself.</p><p>These Ranaldans have been known to join the armies of Bretonnian lords and whisper dissent amongst the ranks, to encourage soldiers to only follow orders which suit them or which genuinely protect the interests of the common man.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Pilgrimage of Fingers</em></h4><p><em>Priests of Ranald lack famous temples or religious sites to visit to show respect to their god. Instead, they can go on the Pilgrimage of Fingers. This requires them to perform a series of eight increasingly difficult tasks within the town, city, or region in which they live. The tasks are assigned by senior priests who take divine inspiration directly from all aspects of Ranald. Each time the pilgrim completes a task, they may tattoo a cross on one of their fingers.</em></p><p><em>Tasks are specific to each priest, and require them to work outside their favoured aspect. They may be inspired by the deeds of famous Ranaldans in the past, such as the Greatest Caper in which a Runefang was stolen from the vaults of Middenheim, or Felix Mann’s theft of the Carstein Ring. Only the most talented and lucky Ranaldans have ever completed each of the eight tasks.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

He has dominion over the beasts of land, air, and river. The weather moves according to his whims and mood. Even earthquakes and landslides are Taal’s to command. To the people of the Old World, Taal and his wife Rhya are the creators of all living things, the most ancient of their gods.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-left\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/images/hut.webp\" width=\"350\" style=\"shape-outside:polygon(0 0, 55% 0, 80% 35%, 100% 100%, 0 100%)\" /></div><p>Taal’s dominion is limited only by the growth of civilisation and the realms of other gods — Manann’s dominion of the sea, Morr’s realm of the dead, and that which is corrupted by Chaos. Taal is the god of spring, who takes over when Ulric’s winter has passed and accompanies his consort Rhya as ruler of summer.</p><p>Taal’s cult is prevalent in the eastern Empire, especially amongst his chosen people in Talabecland. For his followers, he is the almighty lord of a domain that can bring them plenty or end their life. They revere him with offerings, sacrifice, and due respect to the wild places.</p><p>The Cult of Taal insists he is king of the gods, ascendant over all the spirits and minor gods of nature, the Northern Gods, and the Classical Gods from the south. Other cults may disagree, but all gods respect Taal — for the natural world harbours untold power.</p><h3>Spreading Schisms</h3><p>In the first millennium of the Empire’s history, successive Emperors became more corrupt and Sigmar’s unity lost cohesion. In 1023 IC, the outspoken Hierarch Cenwal spoke for many of his fellow priests when he declared that no true god would allow such disorder amongst the ranks of his worshippers.</p><p>Antipathy towards the Cult of Sigmar came to a head in 1360 IC, when Taalite influence in Talabheim encouraged Grand Duchess Ottilia to deny Sigmar’s divinity and break away from the Empire. The Taalites supposedly gave her evidence that Sigmar was a fraud, and her agents took this to the heads of the Ulrican cult in Middenheim. Soon Ar-Ulric denounced the Sigmarites as heretics and decamped to Talabheim.</p><p>Cynical or prejudiced scholars believe Taal’s hierarchs manipulated Ulric’s cult into taking a warlike stance against that of Sigmar — to benefit Talabecland as Sigmarite provinces fought with Ulricans. Others counter that priests of Taal are famously plain-speaking and such power-hungry manipulations would be quite unthinkable for the likes of them.</p><p>The alliance between Talabecland and the Cult of Ulric broke down in 1547 IC. The Talabheim Emperors and presiding influence of the Cult of Taal in the city alienated Ar-Ulric and he returned to Middenheim. This heralded the transition from the Age of Wars to the Age of Three Emperors, as Middenland warred with Talabecland and the cult of Taal grew more militant in the eastern Empire.</p><p>This disunity was broken over 700 years later when Magnus the Pious crusaded to unite the Empire and defy the Chaos hordes. When he arrived in Talabheim, the priests of Taal spurned him, until the wolves of the Taalgrunhaar Forest howled in unison and a stag appeared, marked with a white hammer. As one, the Taalites saw that Magnus had the blessing of their god.</p><h3>The Cult Today</h3><p>The Cult of Taal is no longer the force it was in the old days. The march of civilisation has shifted Taal away from centres of power. He is now chiefly a god of rural people and those who venture into the wilderness.</p><p>Outside Talabheim, priests of Taal prefer to stay away from towns. Yet, all must respect the natural world — after all, even a noble in their Altdorf townhouse ultimately depends on the weather and the seasons to give him food and security. So, Taal is worshipped across the Old World, with only the most zealous cultists of other gods ignoring the Lord of Nature.</p><p>Taal’s early conquests live on as aspects of the god, still worshipped as distinct from his core essence. Therefore, Karog is god of rivers or forests in some regions and Karnos is the god of hunters. Regional gods such as Khirreth (the god of Oberstein Wood in Wissenland) and Shrowl (a Hochland patron of hunters) are typical of local minor gods associated with Taal.</p><p>The folk of the Old World assume that Taal’s cult is untainted by politics, but the truth is far more complex. Beyond the cult strictures, there is no unifying dogma for Taalites and several tendencies vie with one another, pulling the cult in different directions.</p><p>Those priests who favour Taal as King of the Gods see him as a force of masculine power, which is destined to dominate the pantheon once again. They work to assert political and earthly dominance. Others decry the cult’s desire for the comforts of civilisation and worship Taal as the wild force of nature, unrestrained by propriety or the petty laws of men. The schism is not well known outside the priesthood and they would rather it stayed that way.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-7Efdyn9igDIXDGa3\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">A Voice From the Past</h3><p>Over a thousand years ago, a Priest of Taal witnessed his peers forging documents to help spread the heresy that Sigmar was a false god. Wracked by guilt, he implored the other priests not to lie, but they turned on him and took his life. Now Guldag haunts a lost grotto in the Färlic Hills as a spectre, desperate to tell someone what he saw.</p><p>The Cult of Morr have received word of the haunting, and whilst they have more pressing priorities, they plan a future expedition to lay the spirit to rest. The Characters may be brought on to assist the expedition, but can the restless spirit of Guldag manage to pass on his message before he is brought within Morr’s final embrace?</p></section>"

          "text": "<p>Having managed to sit through Professor Pfaff’s exhaustive and exhausting hagiographies of the historical grand theogonists last week, I proposed that he join Professor Gronighof and myself in the saloon bar of the Sullen Knight to discuss a topic of my choosing, that being the early history of the Cult of Taal. I am a noted expert on this subject, having recently published a paper covering it (Beliefs and Rites of the Ancient Taleutens, F. Weirde, Altdorf University Press, 2512 IC). After a few pints of Thunderwater (a passable ale, if a little slimy. I do mourn that we have no access to the Mattheus II under its current management; the fare is so much superior there).</p><p>I began with the basics. Before Humans could read or write, they inhabited a wild world suffused with countless small gods, nature spirits, and divine entities. Most of those are now lost or subsumed under the worship of other gods. Chief amongst them is Taal, who dominated countless other gods and spirits to become Lord of Nature.</p><p>There are no records of Human religious practice from this time, so Taal’s origins are lost in the mists of prehistory. Elves and Dwarfs took little interest in the practices of crude Humans and their primitive beliefs, but as far as Old Worlders are concerned, Taal has been ever-present. </p><p>In recent years, scholars researching Taal’s origins have studied the Talastein Carvings, a series of 13 stone tablets unearthed in the Kölsa Hills. They attest to the body of evidence that supports the notion that an ancient people known as the Belthani venerated a hermaphrodite god called Ishernos, which united all aspects of nature. When they migrated north, they found stone circles and megaliths scattered across the land, relics they believed were left by Ishernos. They used these places as temples. Over time, seasonal aspects of Ishernos split into three entities — Taal the Lord of Nature and Spring, Rhya the Goddess of Fertility and Summer, and Ulric, the God of Wolves, Battle and Winter.</p><p>I outlined this information to my companions, as I find it foundational in studying the history of Taalite practice. Pfaff took it as read, but Gronighof interjected. </p><p>‘This coincides with a tale I was once told whilst planning an expedition to the cairns of the Grey Mountains.’ He said. ‘A hoary old priest of Taal named Pedragar told me that at first there was the Allumina — an unchanging whiteness without feature or motion.’ </p><p>‘Then came Ishernos, the first one, the primal. From its loins came Rhya the beautiful, rising up with Taal the powerful. Surging with life, they came into the world. Everywhere they  gazed, the abundance of nature sprang forth. Where Taal walked, the mountains rose from the earth. Where he breathed, the forests reached for the sun. Such was how the world was made, was what he said.’ He paused to sup at his Thunderwater.</p><p>‘Now, the Elves, they believe differently,’ he said. ‘I was talking to Kaia once about the worship of Taal, and she rolled her eyes and claimed that he is merely a simple-minded attempt to emulate their god Kurnous. According to her telling, early Human settlers in the Old World stumbled across shrines that had been abandoned by the Elves following the War of the Beard and adopted a debased worship of the beautiful statues and frescos they found in the ruins.’</p><p>‘An Elf rolling their eyes?’ said Pfaff. “The phenomena undercuts Leonardo’s doubts about the possibility of perpetual motion!” We all had a good laugh at that. </p><p>Gronighof went on to outline another possibility I had yet to  consider. “Scholars in the south, such as Profesor Mandez of Magritta in his Treatise on the Fur-clad Deities of the North (Spear and Shield Press, 2495 IC) and Parmenus of Tobaro in his Outmoded Gods in Tradition and Practice (Sword and Scales Press, 2488 IC), speculate that Taal was merely the most warlike of many nature deities, growing in influence as his people displaced, assimilated, or killed the followers of other gods. Now, this view is obviously not popular in the Empire,  but Taleuten legends suggest there is truth to the theories. Before the time of Holy Sigmar, they were nomadic, spreading the worship of Taal. Wherever they encountered nature deities, they were absorbed into Taal’s cult. In this way, forgotten gods  such as Medhe, Karog, or Karnos became aspects of Taal.” </p><p>‘So many of the wider pantheon are thus assemblages of forgotten gods,’ said Pfaff. ‘Sigmar alone stands as a clear manifestation of a divine individual, without precedent.’</p><p>‘On the subject of Taleuten legends,’ Gronighof again, ‘have you heard it said that once Taal and Rhya ruled beneficently over all the world, and even while each dallied with other gods and spirits, they always returned to their marital bower at the heart of the land. One day, they say, a group of voyagers came to the world through a hole in the sky. They set about a great plan to tame the wild, manipulating it into straight lines and  bending it to their will. The newcomers invited Taal to join them in their grand endeavour, but he and Rhya turned their backs on them and took no part in it.’</p><p>I decided to carry on with my outline. By Sigmar’s time, Taal was worshipped from the World’s Edge Mountains to the Great Ocean. All tribes had their interpretation of the god. The Unberogens, for example, tended to regard him as a patron of hunters. As villages became towns, folk were close enough to nature to revere Taal as the King of the Gods, who took Rhya as his wife. The world belonged to Taal, other than the fierce wolves, who were the preserve of his brother, Ulric. The Lord of Winter was too proud to submit to his brother’s dominion and the two often came into conflict. Eventually, Taal granted Ulric a season of the year, when he could rule the world as he saw fit. He also gave him a place of his own, the mountain Fauschlag, upon which Middenheim was founded.</p><p>‘We already know this.’ Pfaff waxes peevish whenever one explains matters of Ulrican doctrine.</p><p>Taal and Rhya begat many children — most notably the volatile sea god Manann, who came from their union and inherited the oceans from his father.</p><p>‘I am reminded of a legend remarked upon by Mandez,’ said Gronighof. “He claims that thousands of years ago, what he terms as ‘Daemon Gods’ tore into the world and Taal led the war against them. He and his brother Ulric hewed about them with their axes. His son Manann struck the Daemons with trident and torrent. This is as we might expect, but an unusual aside struck me as odd, for Mandez claims Taal would not stand alongside the vengeful lord or the unchanging light, for the Lord of the Wild saw that they were, in their own way, as terrible as the Daemon Gods themselves.’ </p><p>I decided to discuss what is known about the development of Taalite doctrine. In the distant past, there were no priests of Taal. Over the centuries, a class of wise men and women emerged who led rites in stone circles, oversaw sacrifices, and imbibed herbal spirits to commune with Taal through visions. People feared these holy folk as much as they respected them, just as they treated the natural world with awe and trepidation.</p><p>For many centuries, Taal ruled as King of the Old Gods unchallenged. As the people from the south started to migrate and trade with the northern tribes, the Classical gods spread their influence. The Cult of Taal resented the newcomers as civilisers who enabled men to control nature. Verena sought to know all, even the mysteries of the wild. Shallya looked to reverse the harsh reality of the natural world through pity and healing. Even Myrmidia challenged his brother’s passion for battle. Only Morr was accepted readily by the Cult. It seemed that he was a god they had, in a way, always known.</p><p>‘Yes!’ Gronighof was keen to agree. ‘This synthesises nicely with the Tilean and Estalian authors I have been reading. Of course, their perspective has it that without the resentment and resistance of the Old Gods, advancements in engineering, magical practice, medicine, viticulture, and philosophy would barely exist north of Miragliano. To be honest, I wasn’t sure reading Parmenus whether he felt the introduction of the civilised gods to the Empire hadn’t robbed Tilea of a manifest destiny.’</p><p>I wasn’t sure about that, but either way, the Cult of Taal in the north came to accept the Southern Gods, provided they confined their influence to the towns and cities. </p><p>I explained that my studies led me to believe that in the burgeoning Empire, the Cults of Sigmar and Ulric became politically powerful. Gradually, the Taalites turned further away from the modern world, retreating to the wilds and rural communities on the periphery. Only in Talabecland did Taal’s chosen people keep their god close to the centre of power. Most Taalite priests were content to leave the petty squabbles of men to the other cults. Others resented the loss of influence of their god, especially Sigmar, who had usurped Taal’s prominence in the land. </p><p>‘In the land of the Empire!’ Pfaff said. ‘The land over which he has divine authority by right of his irrefutable majesty.’ I pointed out that I did not deny such matters and was merely trying to outline known facts. Pfaff smouldered and Gronighof tried to mollify us with another tale he had heard.</p><p>‘Another story I had from Pedragar,’ he said, ‘was the King of the Gods sat in his court, Queen Rhya enthroned at his side. It was springtime when all beasts must pay tribute to Taal. First came Raven, who offered counsel and peace for those who pass from life. Wolf came and snarled that he would tear apart any who would usurp the King. Albatross came with salt on his wings, bowed swiftly, and left. Eagle, Owl, and Dove walked with their feathered heads low to the ground. Then came the Prince of Cats. King Taal saw through his flattery and wit as the wily creature tried to steal the King’s helm from his head. Taal banished the Chieftain of Cats from his court… yet to this day, he creeps back in to tease the other beasts.’</p><p>‘Once more, you display an unhealthy affection for the Trickster!’ Pfaff said, and thus ended our productive sharing of wisdom to be replaced with an interminable spat over who was contributing on good faith and whether it would change anything if we could tell anyway.</p>"

          "name": "Holy Orders and Sects",
          "text": "<p>The Cult of Taal is more structured than most people realise, although it does not have the baroque complexity of the Cult of Sigmar or Ulric’s militaristic ranks. High priests rarely dictate the beliefs and practices of subservient clerics, so many small sects and orders persist.</p><h3>The Order of the Antler</h3><p>The largest order, these priests conduct rituals for rural communities and lead people to respect the gods’ ways. They are the priests best known and trusted by the common folk. There is no formal garb — furs and rough cloth are common, usually with a fur headdress adorned with a stag’s antlers. The Order of the Antler is overseen by the Hierarch in Talabheim.</p><h3>Brethren of the Oak</h3><p>Officially a sub-order of the Order of the Antler, the Brethren of the Oak are Priests of Taal who practise within the Eye of the Forest. They are closely affiliated with the noble houses and politics of Talabecland and, as such, are decried as power-hungry by their fellow priests. Their symbol is the antlered oak, often seen depicted on Talabecland heraldry. In the past, Taalite priests have married into noble lineages, despite the cult’s disapproval — it is seen as forsaking the god for temporal power.</p><h3>The Longshanks</h3><p>Taal does not have templar knights like other gods. Instead, there are the Longshanks, resourceful ranger-knights who fight for their god. They wear leather armour and patrol the wilds on foot, sometimes acting as scouts for the Empire’s armies. Mostly they wander alone, seeking those who have corrupted the wild or defied Taal’s name. The Longshanks are an order of loners with a nominal leader in Ulrika Grunfrau, an experienced ranger-priestess, who roams the southern Forest of Shadows, seeking and vanquishing the dark denizens of those woods.</p><h3>Taal’s Wardens</h3><p>A priest tied to one of Taal’s sacred sites or temples is a Warden, charged with keeping it secure from any who would plunder or corrupt the god’s holy places. This does not mean they stay in one place — Wardens patrol many miles from their site, seeking those who may threaten or help protect Taal’s sacred place.</p><h3>Kin of Taal</h3><p>A sect devoted to base masculinity as they believe it is represented in nature. They are responsible for initiating young men in rural settlements in a ceremony known as the Quickening and teaching them how to live from the land by hunting and foraging.</p><h3>Order of the White Stag</h3><p>Taalites are not given much to scholarship or monastic life. The Order of the White Stag are a small order of Taalite monks and hermits who believe that to truly understand and revere their god, they must study how nature works. Most are hermits, living alone in caves and rough shelters. There are very few monasteries of the White Stag — the only substantial abbey is La Maisontaal in Bretonnia.</p><h3>The Horned Hunters</h3><p>The Horned Hunters are zealots who eschew civilisation and prefer to live in the wilds. These fanatical followers of Taal live as close to nature as possible. They shun settlements larger than farmsteads and tiny villages. Many of them even forgo the wearing of clothing. They say Taal’s priests spend more time with people than beasts and believe they have turned their back on their god. The Horned Hunters are ferocious in combat, standing in unshakable defiance anyone that violates the sanctity of the wilderness. Most followers of Taal respect and fear the Horned Hunters, seeing them as touched by their god, and closer to the simple lifestyle followed by the ancient Belthani.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>A Gift from Taal</em></h4><p><em>Having gifted the Fauschlag to his brother, Taal walked east into the forest to find a home for his people. On his journey, he was beset by a colossal Sun Wyrm. Taal battled the Dragon for many weeks before he bested it and thrashed it against the earth again and again. Each time it hit the ground, it gouged out the tributaries of the Upper Talabec river. Taal then threw the Wyrm high into the air and its body plummeted down. When it smashed into the forest, it flattened trees for miles around and formed a wide crater.</em></p><p><em>Taal marked this crater as a homeland for his people and he excavated a hole in the wall for them to discover. Sure enough, hundreds of years later, Krugar of the Taleutens discovered the crater. One myth tells that years later, a bird spirit sent by Taal guided Krugar’s grandson Talgris through the tunnel to found the city of Talabheim.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><p></p>"

          "text": "<h3>The Eye of the Forest</h3><p>Talabheim sits in a vast crater at the heart of the Great Forest, surrounded by a rocky wall known as the Taalbaston. This is known as the Eye of the Forest, a gift from the god to the Taleutens. The land inside the crater is deemed holy ground by the followers of Taal.</p><h3>The Temple of Taal</h3><p>Talabheim’s chief temple is found on God’s Row. At its heart is a wooden hall seating a thousand worshippers. Hierarch Niav presides here, but he rarely attends, preferring to commune with Taal in the Kraterwald. Priests here are mostly Brethren of the Oak, who prefer to spend time close to the politics of the city and province.</p><h3>Kraterwald</h3><p>Taal’s most sacred site in the Empire is an ancient wood covering the eastern expanse of the land inside the crater. Also known as the Taalgrunhaar Forest, venerable oaks, maples, and birch trees enclose groves and winding pathways frequented by priests of Taal in silent acts of worship. Rough-hewn stone sweat lodges lie under blankets of moss, where male gatherers worship their god. In the northern reaches of the forest is a deep grove known as the Horn of Taal, the holiest place in the woods. Several high-ranking priests live here in crude huts.</p><h3>Crystal Lake</h3><p>A pure, clear lake in the east of the crater, also known as Crater Lake. The water is said to be Taal’s tears and many miraculous properties are ascribed to it by superstitious Talabeclanders. It is used to bless holy artefacts, including the amber periapts worn by many priests of Taal.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-vXr1xgWoIbBgyXnH\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">The Kölsa Megalith</h3><p>Antiquarians and academics are organising an expedition to the Kölsa Hills in Talabecland to see if ancient artefacts can be located there. The Characters may be brought on board either as bodyguards or experts in a related field. On site, an ancient megalith is discovered, but its providence is uncertain. Local Taalites worry that any damage to the stone will anger Taal, and their protests against further excavation may turn violent. Irrespective of their concerns, the stone does rest above the corpse of a long-dead manticore, and a necromancer among the archaeologists has plans to raise it as her monstrous steed.</p></section><h3>Compass Monoliths</h3><p>Four great monoliths stand at the cardinal points on the internal crater wall. They are hewn from the rock and inscribed with unknown script by some forgotten hand. The cult say the monoliths mark Taal’s dominion over all land to the north, south, east, and west of Talabheim.</p><h3>The Kölsa Hills</h3><p>The hills in eastern Talabecland are known for countless megalithic stone monuments that trace invisible paths between the hilltops. The whole range was granted to the Hierarch of Taal as a religious preserve by the Ottilian Emperor Helmut II. The Kölsa highlands and valleys remain largely uninhabited, but farmers on the fringes occasionally clear trees to find earthworks and strangely shaped mounds that predate the coming of man.</p><h3>La Maisontaal Abbey</h3><p>High in the Grey Mountains stands the monastery of La Maisontaal, where monks from the Order of the White Stag live in quiet contemplation of Taal’s domain. Formerly, the master of La Maisontaal and head of the order has been the unconventional Priest of Taal, Bagrian. Dressed in distinctive red robes and a curious metal gauntlet, Bagrian took over the abbey’s crypts and made them his private laboratory. He claimed that insights into the natural world could be garnered through magical practices, and had a knack for technological innovation that surpassed the luminaries of the Imperial School of Engineers. Needless to say, neither of these pursuits is thought befitting of a traditional Taalite.</p><p>In 2492 IC, the Lichemaster Heinrich Kemmler joined with a band of Skaven allies to attack the monastery, seemingly seeking the secrets of Bagrian’s research. The monks held out until Tancred, Duke of Quenelles, came to the rescue. The Skaven Grey Seer known as Gnawdoom managed to recover the Black Ark, a holy relic of the ratmen, but Kemmler was thwarted. Tancred ordained that the monastery must be fortified, and work continues to turn it into a fortress. However, recently, Bagrian has disappeared, and without his idiosyncratic leadership, the monks resent the further encroachment of manmade construction on their Taalite refuge.</p><p>The new Abbot of La Maisontaal is Jean-Louis Dintrans. He is a thoughtful, studious man who misses his mentor Bagrian, yet worries about the experiments and strange items hidden in the crypts. This is quite appropriate, for one of those artefacts is the Staff of Nagash…</p>"

          "text": "<p>Taal was the divine patron of the Taleuten tribe that founded Talabheim and populated the land now known as Talabecland. All rulers descended from the tribe are considered chosen by Taal to lead their people. The ruler of Talabheim is known as the Luddataal or ‘Shield of Taal’, a hereditary title that indicates that they have the divine right to rule over the province and all who dwell within. This keeps the usually apolitical Cult of Taal closely tied to the nobility of Talabheim and Talabecland. When Talabecland and Talabheim are united, the ruler also carries the Talabecland title of Grátaal — ‘Beloved of Taal’.</p><p>Despite Taal’s natural aversion to civilisation, there are many priests within Talabheim. They perform a role unlike any other in the Old World — they have an influential voice on the city’s Parliament and the Hunter’s Council that controls the city’s military. Many of Talabheim’s famously byzantine laws originate in Taalite commands from the past.</p><h4>Taal’s Justice</h4><p>At one time, the priests of the cult effectively ruled the city, dispensing ‘Taal’s Justice’ — which involved nailing wrongdoers to the oak trees in the Kraterwald as a form of ordeal, or even execution.</p><p>Such unenlightened and arbitrary punishments are a thing of the past and now the high priests wield less temporal power. Nevertheless, it is notable that many of Talabecland’s noble families feature the antlered tree as a common heraldic device — a reminder that they have always been on the right side of the cult, stand for its principles of justice within a natural order, and are ready to protect the cult from anyone who might threaten it.</p><p>Many of the city’s guilds and military regiments invoke a connection to Taal. For example, the Woodcutter’s Guild members ask Taal’s forgiveness for each tree they take and consider it a violation of guild law to waste wood. Taal’s Chosen are a group of elite woodsmen that patrol within the Taalbaston, protecting Taalites and eliminating any mutant or Beastman that strays within the crater. In times of war, they form an elite scout regiment for the Talabheim State Army.</p><p>The Grand Dukes of Talabecland and Talabheim have always sought to placate the cult of Taal and this favours a more cunning breed of priest to flourish in the city itself. Father Rostov of the Brethren of the Oak is a high priest in the cityâ€™s Temple of Taal.</p><p>He seeks to influence Grand Duchess Elise and encourages her to resist Sigmarite expansion within the province. Thanks to his persistence, the Grand Duchess has sponsored a plan to build large temples in the wilderness to rival those of the other gods. Rostovâ€™s fellow priests are making the same proposals to Count Gustav in Krieglitz.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/card-otilla.webp\" width=\"200\" /></div><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Reiklander Tarock</em></h4><p><em>Shown here is the Empress of Claws, commonly featuring a depiction of Ottilia of Talabecland as one of the two Black Empresses included in the Reiklander Tarock.

In fact, she was a worshipper of Taal (and the design of the card usually includes Taalite imagery such as the stag heads depicted in the decorations on her crown). History remembers her as an Ulrican, however, since she invited the Ulrican cult to move to Talabheim when Ar-Ulric fell out of favour with Graf Heinrich of Middenheim in 1360 IC.</em></p></blockquote>"

Festivities and rituals on these days are shared with the other Old Gods.</p><h3>Mitterfruhl (Start Growth)</h3><p>The Spring Equinox is a joyous occasion and Taal’s chief day of celebration. The god’s strength returns after winter, bringing vitality to the land and fresh breezes to sweep away the frost. Across the Old World, rural folk pay their respects to Taal by sacrificing a young animal and burying it in the woods or offering it to a river.</p><p>Many villages hold a parade, where locals dress in masks and costumes representing beasts, plant life, and other aspects of Taal’s domain — everything from bears, boars, and eagles, to oak trees, wild flowers, and even mountains.</p><p>Tradition dictates that nobody dresses as a wolf (out of respect for Ulric), a sea creature (for Manann is jealous), or a frog (for reasons lost to time).</p><p>The day ends as the sun dips towards the horizon and celebrants separate into men and women to venture into the wilds to sing praise to Taal and ask for clemency from nature’s harsh rule.</p><h3>Run of the Antlers</h3><p>This festival is peculiar to Talabecland. During the first week of Summer-tide, half the young men of the village rise early and don large antlers and a stag’s pelt. The other young men take on the role of hunters, armed with bows and arrows blunted with cloth.</p><p>When the ‘stags’ bolt into the forest, the ‘hunters’ give chase, loosing arrows, hollering, and blowing horns. When all the ‘stags’ are caught, everyone returns to the village to feast and toast the hunt. This festival lasts all week and culminates with young men undergoing the Quickening ceremony to mark their passing to manhood.</p><h3>Sonnstill (Summer Solstice)</h3><p>The longest day of the year is Rhya’s holiest time. Taal’s role on this day is lesser than his consort, but worshippers remember that the wild is always waiting to reclaim what once belonged to Taal. Followers offer prayers to Taal during the festivities and in the eastern Empire, priests make offerings to ask for rain during the driest part of the year.</p><h3>Mittherbst (Less Growth)</h3><p>At the Autumn Equinox, as the year turns towards Ulric’s time, the natural world slows, animals store food for the winter, and the leaves fall from the trees. Worshippers of Taal offer rites to their god to keep the hungry beasts from their door and to ask the Lord of Nature to sleep lightly while Ulric rules over the world.</p><h3>Mondstille (Winter Solstice)</h3><p>Deep in winter, Taal and Rhya slumber beneath the earth. As the shortest day in the calendar, Mondstille represents the turning point towards spring. A feature of these festivities is that worshippers light bonfires to guide Taal and Rhya back into the world.</p><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-gir9cLj5OMLelKTt\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">An Unseasonal Deluge</h3><p>Each year, Altdorf celebrates Sigmar’s final journey on the 15th day of Sigmarzeit, when the citizens of the city partake in a joyous parade. This year’s celebrations were marred by a fierce rainstorm that commenced shortly after the parade began, and finished at dusk. The Hierarch has suggested it is a sign of Taal’s displeasure at being overlooked in favour of Sigmar. The Grand Theogonist has suggested in response that the deluge was a work of Taalite mischief.

          "name": "Relations",
          "text": "<p><strong>Rhya</strong> — The two ruling gods of nature are entwined in the minds of Old Worlders. In some regions (such as Talabecland), Taal dominates and Rhya is worshipped merely as his wife. In these places, priests of Taal can be patronising towards the Cult of Rhya. In other regions, such as Bretonnia and lands dominated by farmland, the fertility goddess takes precedence, implored to divert her consort’s desire to reclaim cultivated land. The cult of Rhya believes life should be nurtured and encouraged, to promote growth and fertility. The cult of Taal takes a more laissez-faire approach to nature, believing the natural world must be allowed to continue untamed. Neither cult is given to philosophical debate, so these differences rarely result in conflict.</p><p><strong>Old Faith —</strong> Relations between the Cult of Taal and the remnants of the Old Faith are complex and there is no consensus amongst priests. The god-and-goddess Ishernos of the Belthani is believed to have given rise to Taal and Rhya, so most followers of Taal respect the Old Faith as an earlier form of their own beliefs. More belligerent Taalites tell tales of their god vanquishing the petty pantheon of the Old Faith, who resisted his majesty. A Stirland folk tale recounts Taal tearing Medhe the Stormlord from the sky with his lightning and thunder. Other older gods, such as Ahalt the Drinker, speak to a savage past where blood rites were considered more fitting sacrifices to the forces of nature than the more sedate pratices of modern Taalites.</p><p><strong>Ulric —</strong> Taal and Ulric’s cults remain loyal to one another, but like most brothers, they still fight at times. Some priests in Ulric’s hierarchy believe Taal’s priests wish to marginalise their spiritual influence in the east, citing past conflicts between Talabecland and Middenland as a precedent. However, in most places in the Empire, the Cults of Taal and Ulric present a united front and priests are often friends or valued allies.</p><p><strong>Manann —</strong> The cults of Manann and Taal keep a respectful distance, separated as the land is distinct from the sea. Taal’s temperamental son is disinterested in the doings of landlubbers and resents the older god’s claim over rivers, which are, after all, tributaries of the seas and oceans. Nevertheless, when faced with a threat from hostile forces or other cults, the priests of Taal will side with those of Manann and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Sigmar —</strong> In past millennia, Taal’s followers were suspicious of the new god Sigmar. His zealous cultists wanted to drive back the frontiers and build temples across the land, diminishing Taal’s realm and persecuting followers of older faiths. Unlike their Ulrican counterparts, Taalites were rarely militant in opposition to Sigmarite ascendence, but a lingering suspicion remained below the surface. Since Magnus the Pious reunited the Empire, Taalites have become more pragmatic, comfortable letting Sigmar rule over people, providing the wilds are left to Taal. That said, there are rumblings in Talabecland that Sigmarite fervour risks inciting conflict between the cults once again.</p><p><strong>Morr —</strong> Taal’s cult has a quiet respect for the god of death. The Lord of Nature is a god of life and his priests believe that all living beings must die in order for new life to spring forth. Priests from both cults officiate in the funerary rites for followers of Taal, to make certain that their soul reaches the afterlife and their body fertilises the earth.</p><p><strong>The Southern Gods —</strong> Taal’s cult rarely fraternises with the Cults of Verena, Shallya, and Myrmidia. Their civilising influence holds little sway in the wild places and the Cult of Taal would prefer it stays that way. Ranald is little more than a perpetual nuisance, although outlaws happily pray to both gods.</p><p><strong>The Ruinous Powers —</strong> Followers of Taal see Chaos as perverting the natural order, violating their god’s domain, and tainting its essence. They have special ire for the Beastmen, who skulk in Taal’s deep woods and wear a twisted appearance as a mocking parody of Taal’s own beasts. Followers of Taal are also strongly opposed to Nurgle, whose ironic virulence distorts nature into something fecund and corrupt.</p><p><strong>The Amber and Jade Orders —</strong> Many shamans of the Amber College are fervent worshippers of the Lord of Beasts, even taking Taal’s arrow as the symbol of their order. The priests of Taal are happy to ally with those who wield Ghur, providing they respect their god as a greater power than any magister could ever command. Relations with the Jade Order are also cordial, as it seems Taal’s holiest sites attract Ghyran readily — a sure sign that the god does not disapprove of the druids’ magic.</p>"

          "text": "<p>Priests of Taal do not typically crave influence or expect hagiography from their followers. Thus, many great Taalites are lost to history, dying unremembered in the wild. Nevertheless, there are several Taalites who have left their mark on the history and culture of the Old World.</p><p><strong>Grand Duchess Ottilia of Talabecland (1320 to 1384 IC)</strong> — A controversial figure in the history of the Empire, the first Ottilian Empress may have sundered Imperial unity, but she was still Grátaal — ‘Beloved of Taal’ and the chosen leader of the descendants of the Taleutens, Taal’s own tribe. Talabeclanders are proud of her independence and Taal’s cult regard her as an important figure in their history, chosen by the King of the Gods to remind his people to tolerate, but never bow to, upstart gods.</p><p><strong>High Priest Ulf Vildsson (1712 to 1786 IC) —</strong> Vildsson was a wandering hierarch who travelled between sacred sites in the northern Empire, blessing Taal’s faithful wherever they were found. He became an emissary for various Human lords to Queen Marrisith of the Eonir, and sometimes interceded on her behalf with the lords of Middenland, Westerland, and the Reikland. He was instrumental in Countess Eleonore of Salzenmund’s accord with the Eonir, breaking many years of conflict between Nordlanders and the Laurelorn.</p><p><strong>Bagrian de Muscadet (2458 IC to unknown) —</strong> The former Master of La Maisontaal, Muscadet was an eccentric priest whose research interests and expeditions aren’t well known within the cult. Bagrian settled into life at La Maisontaal as a monk after years wandering the Old World. He used the monastery as a place to practise secretive esoteric research, which went well beyond the usual preoccupations of Taal’s priests.</p><p>Fascinated by the forms that nature could take, Bagrian took an interest in the Skaven and the strange green stone they used to twist nature. He snuck into Skavenblight and stole the legendary Black Ark. Back at La Maisontaal he used it in his experiments to create artificial life. This culminated in the Battle of La Maisontaal, in 2491 IC, when the Ratmen allied with the Lichemaster and his undead to reclaim the Black Ark. Bagrian disappeared several months ago, but the legacy of his strange studies remains hidden below the abbey.</p><p><strong>Hallowed Mother Tunholda (dates unknown, but she lived in the last century) —</strong> In northeast Stirland, close to the border with Sylvania, a low stone temple stands in the Hundsheimer Wald, built many years ago around an obsidian cromlech. Each stone was put in place by Hallowed Mother Tunholda, who carried them individually in turn from across Stirland and laid them down herself. Tunholda was a charismatic, muscular woman who wore a bison’s pelt in all weathers. As she brought stones from across the province, she attracted local Taalites who followed her across the land, asking for blessings and instructional tales.</p><p><strong>Dirmann (unknown to present) —</strong> A true wild man, Dirmann is a wanderer who dwells in the Great Forest of Talabecland. The Cult of Taal consider him a holy figure, bearing wisdom that seems granted by supernatural means — those who meet Dirmann say he knows all that happens in the halls of men, places he has never been. They say that the trees, birds, and creatures tell him all. It is rare that someone seeking Dirmann can find him. Only those who are devoted to Taal and adhere to his strictures are granted an audience. Dirmann is described as bestial, covered in plant growth as if part of the forest itself.</p><p><strong>Niav, Hierarch of Taal (2487 IC to present) —</strong> The current head of the cult in the Old World is Niav, who has authority over all other priests of Taal. He dwells in the wilds of western Talabecland with his wife Katrinelya, Hierarch of Rhya. Niav is a man of few words, although his lively eyes betray great wisdom. He rarely issues commands to the high priests of the cult, and when attending the Grand Conclave of religious leaders in Altdorf, he says little. When Niav does speak, his voice carries authority and conviction, inspired by Taal. There are rumours that Niav meets with Aldebrand Ludenhof of Hochland when the latter nobleman is out hunting.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Knights of Taal’s Fury</em></h4><p><em>While there are no true knightly templars in Taal’s cult, the Brethren of the Oak patronise a small order of Taalites dedicated to purging the influence of Chaos on the natural world. The Knights of Taal’s Fury are entirely mounted on demigryphs which they must tame themselves, hoping that the blessing of Taal will protect them from their vicious beak and claws.</em></p><p><em>The order’s preceptory can be found near Trautenau in Talabecland, from where they ride forth to hunt down Beastmen in the Great Forest.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Great Horned Helm</em></h4><p><em>The Great Horned Helm is a unique magic item that may be gifted to those Taal finds worthy of bearing it.</em></p><p><em>In the earliest times, Ulric wanted an everlasting winter, where he never relinquished the world from his grasp. The other gods were unhappy and they warred with the Wolf God. In time, Taal and Rhya placated Ulric by showing him that perpetual winter would take all that was good from the world, just as perpetual summer would make men grow lazy and complacent. Ulric made peace and gave each god a gift in contrition.</em></p><p><em>To Taal he gave a magnificent helm adorned with fur and spreading horns.

The priests of Taal insist that this ‘woodhenge’ is sacred to the King of the Gods, as it is made from his oaks and staked out on the land. The priests of Manann argue that, as the henge is submerged for at least half the day, it falls under their domain. Neither cult is willing to give up the henge to the other.

          "name": "Taal across the Old World",
          "text": "<p>There are worshippers of Taal throughout the Old World, although the god’s cult is more influential in the rural Empire than elsewhere. In many places, the worship of Taal has been in slow retreat, as more modern cults assert themselves and urban centres grow.</p><h4>Temples and Shrines</h4><p>Taal’s cult has an aversion to Human construction, so there are relatively few temples built to him. Rather, Taal favours natural features, such as a clearings, pools, or hollows in hillsides and cliffs. The cult also prefers primitive structures such as stone circles, cairns, and cromlechs. When a temple to him is built by Human hands, it will be fashioned from simple uncut stone and overgrown with vegetation. There is usually a stag or bear’s skull over the door and a stone firepit inside — the temples are intended to serve as shelter for travellers as well as places of worship.</p><p>All Taal’s sites are located on the invisible tracks and nodes of the Geomantic Web. There are many which were originally ancient Old Faith sites or Elven shrines. In the Selonian Hills, the Merry Dancers is a hexagonal arrangement of rectilinear standing stones. The priests of Taal have no idea that they once marked an outpost of the Old Ones, predating even the creation of the Elves.</p><p>Priests and devout worshippers also use sweat lodges, which aren’t temples but perform a similar devotional role. They are stone, earth, or wooden cabins with thick hides over the door to hold in the heat, or enclosed pits surrounding a roaring fire. Worshippers take part in ceremonies in the sweltering, smoky atmosphere, chanting and intoning prayers to Taal.</p><h4>Stirland</h4><p>The people of Stirland have always respected Taal and, amongst the simple country folk, he and Rhya traditionally predominate over other cults. In contrast, the nobility trace their legitimacy back to Sigmar, so his cult is preferred by the province’s rulers. In recent centuries, the dominance of Sigmar’s cult has spread from the urban population to the countryside. This is especially true in the east, where Sigmar’s militant following is more fervent and effective in dealing with anything that lurches from the cursed county of Sylvania.</p><p>In the most remote areas of the province, Taal’s worship is still widespread, especially on the fringes of the Great Forest in the north and in the wild valleys of the Stirhügel hills. A common sight on Stirlander buildings is the the Green man, a foliate representation of Taal as lord of plants. It is traditionally carved into wooden beams, furniture, and lintels. Sometimes the Green Man is just a head, but there are full figures — leaf-covered carvings of Taal, clothed in foliage or resplendent in his nakedness.</p><h4>Ostland</h4><p>In Ostland, the Cult of Taal has been in retreat for many centuries, replaced by Ostlanders’ keen Sigmaritism. This has been the source of occasional conflict in the past, but has now settled down. The folk of the province are not disrespectful to Taal and there are shrines and sacred sites in the Forest of Shadows and close to the border with Kislev. The local bull god Guvaur is sometimes assumed to be an aspect of Taal or one of his divine beasts.</p><p>In 1999 IC, a twin-tailed comet devastated the city of Mordheim and Men from across the Empire flocked to plunder the ruins. Ostlander warbands exploring the city were often accompanied by priests of Taal for some mysterious reason. Many of these warbands returned bearing stocks of ‘wyrdstone’, although none of them can attest to what happened to it afterwards. The Cult of Taal hotly denies any accusation that it possesses hoards wyrdstone, or would use it for any reason.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>The Pilgrimage of Stones</em></h4><p><em>Those who wish to prove their dedication to Taal can undergo the Pilgrimage of Stones. They must journey to twelve holy sites in Talabecland on foot, eschewing roads, rivers, and footwear. They can only eat that which they hunt or forage for themselves, and at the twelfth site, they must capture a deer or boar, sacrifice it, then bathe in its blood.</em></p><p><em>Any Character who completes the Pilgrimage of Stones and follows these strictures permanently gains +1 @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.wNvPXAhlKABl6hpk]{Pure Soul} Talent.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Bretonnia</h4><p>Taal’s cult is a peasant’s religion in Bretonnia, favoured by hunters and woodsmen. The nobility view the Old Gods with disdain, suitable for the lower orders but inferior to the Lady. Respectable Taalites are found in a few settlements, such as the Guerac Circle in Mousillon. Quenelles harbours many worshippers of Taal, perhaps related to the influence of the nearby Loren Forest.</p><p>La Maisontaal Abbey stands high in the mountains of the region and there is a cordial relationship between the monks and Duke Tancred, who respects the cult more than most Bretonnian nobles (a situation that might change were he to learn more of bagrian’s experiements).</p><p>Most villages have a small shrine to Taal, but Rhya is more popular, as she offers protection from famine and hardship. Bretonnian outlaws favour Taal, as they use the wilderness as a sanctuary. There are even priests of Taal who join outlaw bands, particularly those who view the Bretonnian nobility with suspicion.</p><h4>Kislev</h4><p>Kislev is a country with vast swathes of untamed wilderness, from the forests of the south to the icy tundra in the north. Amongst the peoples of the more populated south, Taal has long had a place in Kislevite life. The closer one gets to the border with the Empire, the more abundant with life the land is and therefore the more shrines and temples to Taal.</p><p>The late Tsar Boris pushed for a greater respect for the native cults, including that of Ursun, the Kislevite bear god. As a result, in recent decades the worship of Taal has been in decline. Nevertheless, relations between the Cults of Taal and Ursun are harmonious, perhaps because Kislevite Taalites are less insistent that their god is ascendent over other nature deities and spirits. Kislev has its own hierarch, known as Oster, who dwells in a stone circle in the Shirokij Forest, near the capital city.</p><h4>Tilea and Estalia</h4><p>Southern Old Worlders pay little attention to Taal, perhaps because the wilderness is relatively benevolent in comparison with the northern Old World. Tileans call the god ‘Karnos’, a minor god in the pantheon, represented as a more genteel character than northern depictions. A beautiful relief by master sculptor Masacelli of Trantio shows him as an idealised version of a northern barbarian, clad in tidy furs with a manicured curly beard and small antlers projecting directly from his head.</p><h4>Norsca</h4><p>The Norsii tribes who settled Norsca were originally from the northern territories of the Empire. When King Bjorn of the Unberogens and his son Sigmar drove them north across the Sea of Claws, they took the worship of Taal with them.</p><p>In the intervening millennia, their descendents largely abandoned the soft, southern gods in favour of the Ruinous Powers, but there are vestiges of Taal worship remaining amongst the southern tribes such as the Sarls or Bjornlings. For them, Taal is a harsh, uncaring god of nature, who takes a grim pleasure in seeing the unwary perish in the unforgiving Norscan wilderness.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Ahalt the Drinker</em></h4><p><em>One of many nature deities whose cult was vanquished by Taal’s followers before the coming of Sigmar, though a handful of followers remained in hiding around the lands near the Upper Söll River. In secret, successive generations of the arch-druids of Ahalt grew increasingly bitter in their loathing for Taal. Over the centuries, their rites became cruel and bloody.</em></p><p><em>Ahalt’s cult has resurfaced in the southern Empire and cultists known as ‘Black Robes’ hunt and sacrifice priests of hated Taal. Hierarch Niav only recently learned of the extent of Ahalt’s following and Taal’s priests are desperate to destroy the cult.</em></p></blockquote><section class=\"secret hook\" id=\"secret-IVgN4QRlAYCXSKQM\"><p></p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Follow the Green</h3><p>An unknown woodcrafter created dozens of Green Man carvings across Stirland, in private homes, shrines, and inns. As they moved across the province practising their craft, the surviving representations of Taal become stranger and stranger, with odd sprouting protrusions and a root-like beard. Somewhere in the vicinity of Ramsau they carved their last head, almost unidentifiable as Taal and extremely sinister in appearance. When stories start to spread of these carvings springing to life and displaying bloodthirsty behaviour, investigators are tasked with tracking the carver down, or finding out what happened to them.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\">Hands across the Wilderness</h3><p>Once every twenty years, vice-hierarchs from across the Old World meet to discuss matters of great import to the Cult of Taal. They come from Kislev, Bretonnia, and the Empire — there are even representatives from Tilea and Estalia. These occasions are always marred by the coming of the Dire Hierarch, a shaggy, tattooed shaman from across the Sea of Claws, who is shunned by the other high priests. Father Bjorn, a priest of Taal from Nordland, has grown impatient and rash, and seeks to hire the Characters to do away with the Dire Hierarch.</p></section><p></p><p></p>"

          "name": "Ranger-Priest of Taal",
          "text": "<blockquote><p> ‘We serve in the wild places, where Taal bids us to bring his will to those who have never ventured near one of your towns or cities.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Father Siggurd Blumenhal, Ranger-priest</em></p><p>‘I’ve heard it said that the ranger-priests are born when Morrslieb is at its darkest, when nature is ascendant over the Chaos Moon’s influence. All I know is that if it wasn’t for Father Henloch, we would never have escaped the Reikwald.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Cassandra Knecht, Coachwoman</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You stalk the wilds, bringing the blessings of Taal to those who seek his favour, and his judgement to those who abuse or corrupt the natural world.</em></p><p>The Ranger-priests of Taal are men and women who eschew civilisation to devote their lives to serving their god in his own domain. They live amongst nature, roaming the land, performing rites, and keeping it free from corruption.</p><p>Ranger-Priests are just as dedicated to Taal as other priests, but they have chosen to practise by immersing themselves in nature almost permanently. They are renowned for their self-sufficiency when in the wilds and their almost preternatural ability to navigate, deal with wild beasts, and survive on the land.</p><p>What separates them from particularly pious rangers is that they still have priestly duties. They are expected to guide the followers of Taal in prayer and ritual, teaching them to appreciate his works and respect his domain. Unlike a typical priest, they typically fulfil their priestly duties with only six to eight worshippers at a time — a hunting party, a handful of scouts, or a band of outlaws.</p><p>Many Ranger-Priests prefer their own company, but they are not averse to joining bands of travellers temporarily or as long-term companions, if doing so will help them accomplish their religious duties.</p><p>To become a Ranger-Priest, one must be chosen as an Initiate by a more experienced priest. There are several ways this can happen. If someone shows a special affinity for life in the wild places and a reverence for Taal, a senior priest may find them and propose they travel together. Other Ranger-Priests arrive in a remote village or farmstead and expect the locals to find them an initiate from amongst the young people, chosen for their seriousness and an inherent harmony with nature.</p><p>Initiates learn their religious duties and wilderness survival skills by watching and learning from their mentor as they travel. When they are deemed ready, they are taken to a place of significance to Taal, such as a waterfall, cliff face, or copse, where a small group of priests gathers to witness and recognise the occasion. The presiding priest announces their readiness to enter Taal’s priesthood and they are given a trial to hunt enough food for the attending priests. That night, they eat and join their fellow Ranger-Priests in a sweat lodge to celebrate their new status.</p><p>Once a Ranger-Priest attains the status of Vice-hierarch, they become responsible for all priests in a region. These don’t always coincide with political boundaries — they reflect natural features such as forests, river basins, or mountain ranges. Ranger-Priests and more typical priests of Taal are part of the same hierarchy and there is usually mutual respect between the two.</p><p>Ranger-Priests wear practical, sturdy garb rather than vestments. This may be decorated with motifs of antlers, stag’s heads, bears, oak leaves, and similar imagery sewn into the leather or fabric. They wear warm furs and thick travelling cloaks to keep out the cold. Their badge of office is a sturdy walking staff bearing a symbol of Taal and many also carry an amber periapt — a small charm which hangs around their neck.</p><p>All Ranger-Priests lead the rites of Taal. These are ancient rituals of deep mystical significance. Public ceremonies involve singing and chanting, slow coordinated movements, and prayer. They are solemn occasions, especially when making an offering or sacrifice to Taal.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-dslf/assets/misc/taal.webp\" width=\"250\" /></div><p>Ranger-Priests also minister in secret rites with other priests, which they deem essential to maintain the careful balance of nature. These are uninhibited affairs, often involving the ingestion of strong rough alcohol and intoxicating mushrooms in shamanic rituals and ordeals of faith. The priests hope to commune with Taal through visions and shared consciousness.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"no-toc sidebar-title\"><em>Curse of Taal</em></h4><p><em>If a priest of Taal incurs the wrath of their god, he may strike them with his own savage curse.</em></p><p><em>If a player rolls over 151 on the @Table[wrath]{Wrath of the Gods Table}, you can substitute the result in the Core Rulebook for the Curse of Taal — unless they spend a Fate Point, their mind is reduced to that of a brute animal.

Do they sympathise with those who believe political and urban power is the only way to ensure the survival of the cult? Or do they see towns and cities as the preserve of tamed, ‘backsliding’ priests?</p><h4>Wandering Priest</h4><p>A priest who tends to followers in many settlements, or across a particular area of wilderness, rarely stays in one place for long. They may range across a specific forest or expanse of hills. Alternately, they could live a nomadic life, wandering across the whole Old World, moving with the seasons. These Characters are well-suited to adventuring. </p><p>Use the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.h1l9jvaIxsb92wtM]{Priest} Career from the <strong>WFRP Core Rulebook</strong>, or a @UUID[.oX0kC1ZcVXECJkta]{Ranger-Priest} for those who practise their calling in the most remote places.</p><h4>Settled Priest </h4><p>A settled priest is bound to protect and maintain a holy site of Taal or serve a fixed community. This limits their movement, but if your game is centred around a suitably rural location, it could work well as they will be invested in the protection and upkeep of a nearby site, such as an ogham stone circle, enchanted glade, or ancient barrow. </p><p>Use the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.h1l9jvaIxsb92wtM]{Priest} Career from the <strong>WFRP Core Rulebook</strong>, or a @UUID[.oX0kC1ZcVXECJkta]{Ranger-Priest} if their role is more focused on protecting a site than tending to followers.</p><h4>Nuns and Monks</h4><p>If a player wants to join the Order of the White Stag or play as a hermit, they could make a good Character for a party. Such Characters occasionally venture forth to fulfil some purpose inspired by Taal.</p><p>Use the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.f5m7s9K2y1zQNmej]{Nun} Career with the following Skills at level 1:</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.fdq3RFSOKl5b3WzW]{Art (Calligraphy)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.pxNjTxsp1Kp0SmQe]{Cool}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.0CwV96kTDRF0jUhk]{Entertain (Storyteller)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.RLQHm1s4IuY9RSr2]{Gossip}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.HXZaV1CJhmTvcAz4]{Heal}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.d9bGxy6Y3u3rOHIN]{Lore (Theology)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.items.Item.9xR9uO8FIvi4YsJp]{Pray}</p></li></ul><h4>Longshanks</h4><p>A member of the Longshanks order of Ranger Knights is an excellent concept for a Character.
